<p>How important is business for a company?</p>

<p>Development needs get ignored much of the time in favour of the more tangible front-end and business requirements.</p>

<p>â€”Making It Right</p>

<p>For every company that considers software product as one of their Key Assets, technical needs should be among their top priorities, alone with business needs and user needs.</p>

<p>For outsourcing products though, this is often not the case. Outsourcing products are often non-key to client companies, because no company will outsource their key assets. To them, technical needs are often ignored much of the time in favour of the more tangible front-end and business requirements.</p>

<p>But ignoring technical needs only leaves to disaster. Thatâ€™s why outsourcing products are often short-lived, because they couldnâ€™t live up their own weight and eventually collapse.</p>

<p>If the debt grows large enough, eventually the company will spend more on servicing its debt than it invests in increasing the value of its other assets.</p>

<p>â€”Making It Right</p>

<p>So letâ€™s accept the fact that outsourcing products are by definition crap, unless someone stand up against the ignorance of technical needs. I think we as the ones who bear under the development, should stand up and shout for technical needs. Because if succeeded, it will make everyoneâ€™s life better.</p>

<p>Treat business needs and user needs no different than technical needs, theyâ€™re born equal. So donâ€™t treat feature testing more important than unit testing.</p>

<p>Long term success over short term success. Meaning alway do the right thing in long term, not short term.</p>
