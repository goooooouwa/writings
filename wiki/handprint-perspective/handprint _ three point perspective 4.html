          <h2>three point perspective</h2>

          <p>At this point it's customary to explore the capabilities of 2PP in a variety of specific drawing problems.
            I want to keep the momentum and look at <b>three point perspective</b>, which allows you to construct a form
            in any orientation (from any viewpoint).</p>

          <p>Three point perspective is often illustrated with aerial views of Manhattan, looking down on a skyline
            bristling with skyscrapers. But artists will find 3PP equally useful in still life or figure paintings —
            where the view downward onto a table of objects or a piece of furniture can be just as steep — and in
            landscape views up toward soaring cliffs or a stand of tall trees.</p>

          <p>The 3PP perspective problems and construction methods are complex, and it may seem we lose more in clarity
            than we gain in drawing power. Many artists have come to the same conclusion, and avoid 3PP for simpler
            approaches, including freehand modification of drawings blocked out in 2PP, or the expedient of <a
              class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/tech36.html#tracing">tracing photos</a>.</p>

          <p>I won't disagree with those solutions; they can be convenient and effective. They fall short, however, if
            you must add new forms around the primary form — for example, if you have traced the photograph of an
            existing building, and want to insert new or different buildings around it — or if you want to show the
            building from a different point of view, or require more precision than freehand perspective can provide.
            For these common situations, 3PP is invaluable.

          <h3>three point perspective</h3>

          <p>As we add vanishing points, we remove aspects of perspective that we can take for granted. In 1PP or
            central perspective, the relationship of the vanishing points and horizon line to the direction of view are
            taken for granted. In 3PP both the vanishing point locations and the relationship between in the direction
            of view and the ground plane (horizon line) must be specified.</p>

          <p><span class="rubric1">Defining Features of Three Point Perspective</span>. The diagram shows the simplest
            3PP situation: a cube centered in view but first rotated 45° to one side and then downward until all front
            faces appear of equal size. In all <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#vptypes">three point perspective</a> views there are
            <i>no faces or edges parallel with the picture plane.</i></p>

          <p>In particular, because the direction of view is still assumed to be perpendicular to the image plane, the
            direction of view is <b>no&nbsp;longer parallel to the ground plane</b> when the primary forms are
            constructed as buildings are, with walls perpendicular to the ground.</p>

          <p>The canonical view places the three front edges of the cube in a 54.7° angle to the direction of view, so
            that all three vanishing points are outside the circle of view. The planes of the three front faces are at a
            35.3° angle to the direction of view, with vanishing lines defined by the triangle of three vanishing
            points.<a name="3PPcanonical">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec5a.gif" width="313"
              height="308"></p>
          <p class="CC">three point perspective: the basic geometry</p>

          <p>The three <b>vanishing points</b> (<b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>vp</b><sub>2</sub> and <b>vp</b><sub>3</sub>)
            control the recession of all <i>lines</i> parallel to the edges of the cube. This means the outline of each
            face is determined by two vanishing points, rather than one as in 2PP.</p>

          <p>Connecting the vanishing points are three <b>vanishing lines</b>, which control recession of all
            <i>planes</i> parallel with each front and matching back face of the cube and all planes parallel to them.
            Each vanishing line also contains the vanishing points for all lines parallel to their respective planes,
            including the diagonal vanishing points (<b>dvp</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>dvp</b><sub>2</sub> and
            <b>dvp</b><sub>3</sub>) for the planes.</p>

          <p>A vanishing line perpendicular to the viewer's vertical orientation (parallel to the ground plane) is
            typically the <b>horizon line</b> in architectural or landscape uses of perspective. It is the vanishing
            line for all planes parallel to the ground plane, and contains all vanishing points for lines parallel to
            the ground plane (perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule13">rules&nbsp;13 and 14</a>).</p>

          <p>Each vanishing line is connected to the vanishing point opposite to it by an <b>auxiliary horizon line</b>
            (shown in orange in the figure). These are the <i>vanishing lines for measure points</i> for each of the
            three dimensions of the cube. In 2PP, the horizon line was a vanishing line for both the vanishing points
            and measure points, but in 3PP these functions can be separated.</p>

          <p>The auxiliary horizon lines always <b>intersect at the direction of view</b> (the principal point) — that
            is, they link the vanishing points of the object to the vanishing point of the viewer's central recession
            (perspective gradient). Therefore the <b>principal point is always inside the vp triangle</b> formed by the
            three vanishing lines: if it is not, then the primary form does not define right angled vanishing points (it
            is a pyramid or a lopsided cube).</p>

          <p>The measure points become significantly more complex in the 3PP orientation: <b>two vanishing points define
              the edges of each face</b>, and each edge requires its own measure point. So we have in all six <b>measure
              points</b> (<b>mp</b><sub>1</sub> to <b>mp</b><sub>6</sub>) — two for each vanishing point in relation to
            the two faces it governs.</p>

          <p>Finally, with the visual ray method we had a simple way to <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect3.html#rotatingvp">rotate the vanishing points</a> in 2PP,
            but this also becomes significantly more complex in 3PP. In 2PP we just had to rotate two faces joined in
            <i>one</i> right angle, which we could easily diagram in two dimensions as two lines joined in one angle. In
            3PP we must rotate three faces joined in <i>three</i> right angles, and that complicates the visual ray
            approach to a perspective solution.<a name="3PPhorizon">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><span class="rubric1">Direction of View &amp; Horizon Line</span>. A 3PP construction <b>allows the
              direction of view to be oblique to the ground plane</b>, so that we are <i>looking down or up</i> on
            objects rather than looking at them directly from one side. Consequently in 3PP it is necessary to
            distinguish between (1) the object geometry (the vanishing points defined by the edges of the primary form),
            (2) the central recession defined by the direction of view, and (3) recession on the ground plane, for
            example in the visual texture of forests, grassy plains, deserts or bodies of water.</p>

          <p>For example, we can redraw the cube illustrated above in <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect3.html#2PPcanonical">two point perspective</a> so that it
            has exactly the same angular size in the field of view (using a measure bar), and is positioned below the
            direction of view so that we look down on its upper face at a 35° angle. This locates the top front corner
            on the 71° circle of view and the bottom front corner just in front of the ground line (diagram, below).</p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec5n.gif" width="298"
              height="247"></p>
          <p class="CC">the 3PP canonical view in two point perspective</p>

          <p>Because both the angular size of the cube and the angle of its faces to the direction of view are
            identical, we are viewing it from <b>exactly the same location in physical space</b>. All we have done is <a
              class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#turninghead">shift our gaze</a> from
            the object itself to the horizon line behind it. This keeps the same visual angle between the front corner
            of the cube and the horizon line. But changing the direction of view in 3PP means that:</p>

          <p>(1) the horizon line no longer must intersect the principal point, and in fact may no longer be within 90°
            circle of view; and</p>

          <p>(2) the geometrical relationship between any two vanishing points (the size and shape of the triangle the
            vanishing points define on the image plane) depends on the location of the third vanishing point and the
            location of the direction of view (the orientation of the image plane to the perspective problem).<a
              name="space">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <h3>the perspective sketch construction method</h3>

          <p>The solution is basically to draw the form first, so you can locate the vanishing points and measure points
            which will produce that perspective view. You then use these to reconstruct the primary form in accurate
            perspective, and to add objects around the primary form within the same perspective space.</p>

          <p>Why not draw the primary form by freehand perspective alone? Because, as we've already seen in 2PP, <a
              class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect3.html#vpspacing">inaccurate placement of
              vanishing points</a> results in a distorted perspective view; even small distortions can be obvious in a
            finished drawing. There is a better way.</p>

          <p>You start with a <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/tech13.html#perspective">freehand
              perspective sketch</a> or scaled down perspective drawing at the center of a fairly large piece of paper
            (a 3' section from a roll of wrapping paper or white butcher paper is ideal).</p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec5b.gif" width="320"
              height="224"></p>
          <p class="CC">three point perspective: perspective sketch of the primary form</p>

          <p>Your drawing or photograph of the primary form should be small enough to fit all perspective points on the
            sheet of paper, yet large enough to work with accurately — usually a drawing about 10cm or 4 inches on its
            longest side is practical.</p>

          <p>Take your time with the freehand drawing, and try to capture the relative proportions of the dominant edge
            angles and faces as accurately as you can. Don't worry about extraneous features (such as doors, windows or
            domes): you want to capture the basic perspective shape as it recedes in three directions. Be sure to define
            the edges and corner points clearly.</p>

          <p>You can also start with a drawing or photograph of a building or monument that presents clear vanishing
            lines in its edges or surfaces, in the perspective orientation you want to duplicate. This photograph is
            only used to <b>specify the approximate perspective view</b> of the primary form in the drawing, so it does
            not have to look anything like the primary form you actually want to draw.</p>

          <p>Once the drawing is finished to your satisfaction, or you have taped your photograph to the sheet of paper,
            you draw <b>prospecting lines</b> from the edges of the front planes to find the three vanishing points.
            Using a ruler or yardstick, <b>extend the outer edges</b> of the form until these prospecting lines
            intersect at three separate points. In a cube you have three edges tending to each vanishing point; use
            these in combination to reconcile discrepancies and find the point that gives all three the best definition.
          </p>

          <p><span class="rubric1">The Vanishing Line Triangle</span>. Next, connect these three vanishing points with
            three vanishing lines. You have defined the <i>vanishing line triangle</i> that will define (and usually
            contain) the primary form.</p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec5c.gif" width="354"

          <p class="CC">three point perspective: the vanishing line triangle</p>

          <p>This is the point to look at the overall placement of the vanishing points in relation to the primary form
            and the space around it that will appear in the finished drawing. You can block in the format outline, or
            sketch other large forms around the primary form, to make sure you will get the effect you want.</p>

          <p><span class="rubric1">Constructing Auxiliary Horizon Lines</span>. Next, <b>draw the three auxiliary
              horizon lines</b> through each vanishing point and perpendicular to the opposite vanishing line. There are
            two ways to do this. The quicker is to use a large carpenter's square, laying one side against each
            vanishing line and sliding it back and forth along the line until the other arm is exactly on the vanishing
            point. Then draw the line.</p>

          <p class="CC">three point perspective: constructing the auxiliary horizon lines</p>

          <p>A more accurate method in large drawings is to <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/construct.html#perpendicular">construct the perpendiculars</a>
            using a long piece of fishing line, hemp (not stretchable cotton) string or strip of cardboard as a compass
            measure. With your thumb, a tack or a piece of tape, fix one end of the measure at the vanishing point, and
            with the other end scribe a wide pencil arc across the opposite vanishing line. (Put the tip of the pencil
            through a loop in the string or a small hole in the cardboard strip.) The arc must intersect the vanishing
            line at two widely spaced points. Then either scribe two intersecting arcs centered on each of these new
            points, or measure with a ruler 1/2 the distance between them.</p>

          <p>In the figure, the two arcs have been scribed around <b>vp</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>vp</b><sub>2</sub>, and
            through <b>vp</b><sub>3</sub>, to define the new points <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>. Intersecting arcs drawn from
            <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>vp</b><sub>3</sub> create the new points <b>P1</b> and <b>P2</b>; lines to these
            points from the corresponding vanishing points create two auxiliary horizon lines. The direction of view
            (<b>dv</b>) is always at the intersection of all three auxiliary horizon lines, so the third line can simply
            be drawn from <b>vp</b><sub>3</sub> through <b>dv</b> to the opposite vanishing line. You end up with a
            <b>vanishing line triangle</b> similar to the one shown above.</p>

          <p>Didn't I say elsewhere that the <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect3.html#vpspacing">freehand placement</a> of vanishing
            points leads to distortions? No: it's the <i>clumsy scaling</i> of <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#distance">drawing size</a> in relation to the
            distance between the vanishing points that introduces distortions. If your three auxiliary horizon lines are
            at right angles (perpendicular) to their vanishing lines, if they meet in a single point (<b>dv</b>), and if
            this point is inside the vanishing line triangle, then the triangle defines a valid (physically possible)
            perspective space for a rectilinear solid.</p>

          <p><span class="rubric1">Constructing the Circle of View</span>. Now we insert the <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#framework">90°&nbsp;circle of view</a>. This
            requires you to (1) find the midpoint of any of the three vanishing lines (connecting two vanishing points),
            (2) draw a <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect3.html#circlethales">semicircle of

            second arc back to this parallel line. The intersection of this arc with the parallel line defines the
            radius of the 90° circle of view around <b>dv</b>.</p>

          <p>In the traditional solution, the artist uses either a ruler or the method of <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/construct.html#bisectline">intersecting arcs</a> to find the

            inscribed across the vanishing line from the two vanishing points, they intersect at two points, <b>x</b>

          <p>(2) From point <b>M</b> the artist constructs a <i>semicircle of Thales</i> between the two vanishing
            points, then (3) extends to the semicircle the auxiliary horizon line that intersects the inscribed

            auxiliary horizon line.)</p>

          <p>(4) Next, the artist constructs a line through <b>dv</b> that is parallel to the vanishing line.</p>

          <p>(5) Finally, the artist inscribes an arc from <b>P</b> with radius equal to <b>PC</b>, the extended segment
            of the auxiliary horizon line. This intersects the line parallel to the vanishing line at either <b>H1</b>
            or <b>H2</b>, depending on where it is more convenient to construct the arc.</p>

          <p>(6) The line segments <b>dv-H1</b> or <b>dv-H2</b> are equivalently the radius of the 90° circle of view.
            The artist draws this circle from <b>H1</b> (<b>H2</b>) with <b>dv</b> as its center.</p>

          <p>It is often useful to include the 60° circle of view, which is a second circle with a radius equal to 0.58
            (58%) of the radius of the 90° circle of view. This completes the perspective space.

          <p><span class="rubric1">Locating Measure Points</span>. The last step is locating the measure points. Six are
            required if they are marked along the vanishing lines, but only three if you locate them on the auxiliary
            horizon lines.</p>

          <p><b>Auxiliary Horizon Line Measure Points</b>. To find the measure points on the auxiliary horizon lines,

          <p class="CC">three point perspective: finding the measure points</p>

          <p>This completes the perpective space at a reduced scale. I find that this entire procedure, starting with a
            blank sheet of paper and ending with the finished perspective space, <b>requires about 20 minutes to
              complete</b>. Once you understand how to do it, the work goes quickly and smoothly.</p>

          <p>You must carefully make seven measurements on this drawing (using a metric ruler) to rescale it to full
            size: (1) the longest distance between any two vanishing points (in the example, <b>vp</b><sub>3</sub> to
            <b>vp</b><sub>2</sub>), (2) the distance from one of these vanishing points to the intersection with the
            auxiliary horizon line (<b>vp</b><sub>3</sub> to <b>h</b>), (3) the length of this auxiliary horizon line
            (<b>h</b> to <b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>), (4) the length to the direction of view (<b>h</b> to <b>dv</b>), and
            finally (5-7) the distance from <b>dv</b> to each of the three measure points.</p>

          <p>Divide the radius of the circle of view you want in the full sized drawing (say, 160cm) by the radius of
            the circle of view in your perspective sketch: multiply all the measurements by this number. This gives you
            the full scale perspective space. Your perspective work surface needs to be at least as long as the longest
            vanishing line and as wide as the 90° circle of view. In the example drawing, assuming a 3m circle of view,
            this would be roughly 5m by 3m.</p>

          <p>On a surface large enough to accommodate these distances (a very large table, or a clean hardwood or
            linoleum floor, or a clean, flat patio, garage floor or driveway), measure out the longest vanishing line
            (in the figure, <b>vp</b><sub>2</sub> to <b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>), and the auxiliary horizon line to
            <b>vp</b><sub>3</sub>. Connect the three vanishing points to define the vanishing line triangle. Measure the
            distance from the vanishing line to <b>dv</b>, and draw the remaining two auxiliary horizon lines from the
            vanishing points through <b>dv</b>. Finally, mark the three <b>mp</b>'s on each auxiliary horizon line,
            measured from <b>dv</b>.</p>

          <p>Use the <i>drawing scale</i> shown in the <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#distable">distance to size</a> table to <b>compute
              the drawing scale</b> — the percentage of the actual object size (for a given viewing distance) that the
            drawing of the primary form should have. On a piece of paper, make a rough sketch of the primary form at
            this size, and lay the sketch on the format (size of support) you intend to use, to make sure the
            proportions work.

          <p><b>Vanishing Line Measure Points</b>. The 3PP method of using three measure points is convenient, but it
            fails when the anchor point for measurements is close to the direction of view (<b>dv</b>). In this case,
            you may want to use the vanishing line points instead.</p>

          <p>The construction of the circle of view required a semicircle of Thales drawn around one of the vanishing
            lines, centered on <b>M</b> and intersecting the vanishing points at either end of the vanishing line, then
            extended the auxiliary horizon line to intersect the semicircle in a point <b>h'</b>. This is all you need
            to define the measure points on that vanishing line. (Note that you can save steps and work space by
            intersecting the auxiliary horizon line inside the perspective triangle, to define <b>interior h'</b>, and
            construct the measure points from there.)</p>

          <p class="CC">three point perspective: alternate method to define measure points</p>

          <p>The point <b>h'</b> will always define a 90° angle with the two vanishing points on the vanishing line.
            That is, it is equivalent to the viewpoint in a 2PP rotation of vanishing points. So you can draw two arcs
            from this point back to the vanishing line, using each vanishing point as the center of an arc, to define
            the measure points for the vanishing line — just as you would in <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect3.html#2pperspective">two point perspective</a>.</p>

          <p>Confusion about the choice of vanishing line measure points is usually dispelled by the following two
            criteria:</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The controlling vanishing point is the <b>vanishing point for the convergence of the edges</b> that
            are being sized by the measure bar. Thus, edges converging to the right side vanishing point
            (<b>vp<sub>2</sub></b>) are controlled by that vanishing point.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The measure point to use was <b>defined by an arc from the controlling vanishing point</b>. Thus,
            <b>mp<sub>4</sub></b> was defined by an arc centered on <b>vp<sub>2</sub></b>, so <b>mp<sub>4</sub></b> is
            the measure point to use when sizing edges that recede to that vanishing point. The height dimension is
            controlled by the vertical vanishing point (<b>vp<sub>3</sub></b>), which was the center of the arc used to
            define <b>mp<sub>3</sub></b>.</p>

          <p>Measure bars to the vanishing line measure points <b>always must be parallel to the vanishing line</b>
            containing the measure point being used, not to any auxiliary horizon line as before. Note that two measure
            points are always available for each dimension. In the example, <b>mp</b><sub>6</sub> can be used to size
            the vertical edges receding to <b>vp</b><sub>3</sub>, if for some reason <b>mp</b><sub>3</sub> is
            inconvenient to use — but in that case, the measure bar must be parallel to the vanishing line containing
            <b>mp</b><sub>6</sub>.</p>

          <p>The measure bars in the illustration are the same length as those used previously, and as you can see, they
            define the same reduction in perspective depth. You do not need to rescale or recompute the measure bars you
            already have; just align them parallel with the appropriate vanishing line.</p>

          <p>Because the semicircle on <b>M</b> is part of the circle of view procedure, and any vanishing line can be
            used to define the circle of view, you should consider the location of your anchor points in the perspective
            space, and place the semicircle of Thales around the vanishing line where measure points will be most
            convenient.</p>

          <p>For example: I had originally put the anchor point at the front bottom corner of the cube; in that location
            <b>mp</b><sub>3</sub> worked fine, but the other two points created badly slanting measure lines that would
            introduce inaccuracies. The best alternative points would be found on the top vanishing line (between
            <b>vp</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>vp</b><sub>2</sub>), so I should have started building the circle of view by
            putting the first semicircle on that side.

          <p>Measure out the perspective space on the perspective drawing surface (floor, driveway, patio), and <b>tape
              or tack the support to the surface</b>, oriented with the top edge parallel to one of the vanishing lines
            (or to none, if the perspective view is tilted), and the <b>dv</b> in the correct location within the
            drawing. If you do not want to work directly on your watercolor paper, reconstruct the drawing on a large
            sheet of butcher paper or wrapping paper, and then trace or <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/tech36.html#squaring">square the drawing</a> to the format when you
            are done.</p>

          <p>Mark the <b>dv</b> and draw the auxiliary horizon lines, the measure points, the anchor point, and the base
            vanishing lines through the anchor point.</p>

          <p>The diagram shows this done on an emperor sheet, 40" x 60", located with the <b>dv</b> near the bottom. (If
            you are going to all this trouble, you may as well make the painting spectacular!) For clarity, the support
            outline is omitted in the next several illustrations, although it is assumed you are working with the
            support in place.</p>

          <p class="CC">three point perspective: constructing measure bars</p>

          <p>The last preparatory step is constructing the measure bars. Do this from the center of the space
            (<b>dv</b>), because each measure bar must be parallel with its corresponding auxiliary horizon line. This
            is easiest to do by simply drawing the measure bar on a separate sheet of paper, directly over the auxiliary
            horizon lines.</p>

          <p>Draw the measure bars to the perspective length they have in space, so that you can line them up with one
            end against the anchor point. The length of the measure bars determines the <i>drawing size</i> of the
            primary form, so you want these to be accurate. For example, if the dimensions of a building are 150 feet
            long, 75 feet wide and 36 feet high, and you used the length of the building to scale the drawing size, then
            the proportions between the measure bars are 1.00 to 0.50 and 1.00 to 0.24. Since we are drawing a cube, all
            three measure bars will be of equal length, so we define them by drawing a circle around <b>dv</b> (shown
            above).</p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec5i.gif" width="352"

          <p class="CC">three point perspective: constructing front vertical</p>

          <p>The rest is a piece of cake. First, align the vertical measure bar parallel to the vertical auxiliary
            horizon, with the bottom end on the anchor point. Draw a line from <b>mp</b><sub>3</sub> through the top end
            of the measure bar to the vertical vanishing line (that is, the line parallel to the measure bar you are
            using). This defines the front height of the cube.</p>

          <p>Using a yardstick, string or cardboard strip aligned with the bottom vanishing point, draw a line from the
            anchor point to the line from the vertical measure bar to <b>mp</b><sub>3</sub>. This is the front vertical.
            Use the yardstick, string or cardboard strip to connect the ends of this vertical to the two side vanishing
            points, and draw the front top and bottom edges of the form.</p>

          <p class="CC">three point perspective: constructing left side</p>

          <p>Next, use the second measure bar to define the depth dimension on one side (to <b>mp</b><sub>1</sub>, the
            measure point on the auxiliary horizon line parallel to the measure bar you are using). When one end of the
            measure bar is aligned with the anchor point, the back corner of the cube is located where the line from the
            other end of the measure bar to <b>mp</b><sub>1</sub> crosses the bottom left edge of the figure. Mark this
            point.</p>

          <p>Again aligning your straight edge with <b>vp</b><sub>3</sub>, draw a line from this point to the top left
            edge line: this is the back vertical of the cube. Connect the ends of this vertical along vanishing lines to
            <b>vp</b><sub>2</sub>. These lines define the back left upper and lower edges of the figure.</p>

          <p>With the third measure bar, construct the opposite side, define the corners, and connect to the vanishing

          <p>Clean up the drawing as much as necessary to visually confirm the final perspective outline meets your
            expectations. Then go on to add any other objects in the environment around the primary form, or perspective

          <p>Familiarity with the 3PP mechanism will help you understand how to use it effectively. The diagram (above)
            gives some clues about the scale, placement and cropping of forms:</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;In general, distortions toward the side vanishing points are much more objectionable than those
            toward the bottom vanishing point: <b>choose a vertical or square format</b> whenever feasible.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;Forms can be placed below the <b>90° border</b> — a 90° angle placed to intersect the two side
            vanishing points (red line) — to emphasize height or vertical scale, but forms should not be placed near the
            border on either side. (All possible locations of the right angled corner of this border are defined by a <a
              class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect3.html#circlethales">circle of Thales</a>
            constructed below the horizon line.)</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The same circle of view rules apply in order to reduce <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#bestview">perspective distortions</a>, but the
            circle can be displaced downward from the direction of view, as if pulled away from the horizon line by the
            vertical depth. It is better to think in terms of a <b>column of view</b> centered on the principal point
            and extending from below the 90° border to above the horizon line (where cloud layers in perspective can
            enhance distance depth to balance the vertical depth). Any format that fits within a 40° to 60° column will
            produce a handsome image.</p>

          <p>When you have finished with the perspective elements, carefully release the drawing surface from the table,
            floor or patio, and lay it out on your painting surface to erase the guidelines, measure points, and other
            extraneous elements, or to transfer the perspective outline to the actual painting surface. When the drawing
            is fully cleaned, add by freehand any additional outlines or guidelines necessary before you begin to paint.

          <h3>the horizon line construction method</h3>

          <p>Two significant problems with the perspective sketch method are that it establishes the angles of the the
            primary form to the viewpoint approximately, through a sketch, and that it cuts the 3PP methods loose from
            the procedures for <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#drawingscale">scaling the drawing</a> within the
            circle of view. The actual perspective angles and scale of the circle of view are derived from the drawing,
            rather than given at the start. An alternative method is to start with the circle of view, and from there
            construct the vanishing points. This method starts by specifying the location of the horizon line (a
            horizontal vanishing line above or below the direction of view), so I refer to it as the <b>horizon line
              method</b> of 3PP construction, though the <i>circle of view method</i> is also apt.</p>

          <p>A discussion of the 3PP geometry will clarify how this method works. Because all parallel lines converge to
            the same (single) vanishing point (perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule6">rule&nbsp;6</a>), and the 3PP vanishing
            points define visual rays at right angles to each other, the 3PP vanishing points are equivalently defined
            by the three right angled edges of a cube that can be turned or rotated around a front corner fixed on the
            direction of view (diagram, right).</p>

          <p>These edges converge to the three right angle vanishing points at the vanishing lines for the three planes
            defined by the three front faces of the cube (perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule14">rule&nbsp;14</a>). Therefore the vanishing
            lines between the pairs of vanishing points will be parallel to the line intersections of the three front
            faces of this cube with the image plane (green, corollary to perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule11">rule&nbsp;11</a>). As a result, we have
            reduced the geometry of the 3PP vanishing points to the geometry of a three sided pyramid thrust through the
            image plane in any arbitrary angle and rotation.</p>

          <p>As explained earlier, the circle of view framework provides a method to specify exactly the location of any

            require is a way to perform this folding for elements of the 3PP "pyramid".</p>

          <p>This is done by <b>moving the fixed corner of the cube forward until it coincides with the viewpoint</b>.
            In that position its three edges define three visual rays to the vanishing points (magenta lines, diagram

            to it, and the direction of view. These are found by folding into the image plane a <i>vertical section</i>
            of the pyramid defined by an auxiliary horizon line, for example the interior triangle <b>PVC</b> defined by
            the auxiliary horizon line <b>PC</b> in the diagram above. This triangle contains the two triangles
            <b>VdvC</b> and <b>VdvP</b>, each containing a right angle at <b>dv</b>. The fold brings line <b>Vdv</b>
            into the image plane as <b>x'dv</b>. Because the edge <b>Cdv</b> is continuous with edge <b>Pdv</b>, the
            right angle at <b>dv</b> is preserved. And the image edges <b>Cx'</b> = <b>CV</b> and <b>Px'</b> =
            <b>PV</b>. Therefore, by triangular equalities, the image angle <b>1'</b> equals the interior angle
            <b>1</b>, the angle between the direction of view and the face <b>ABV</b>.</p>

          <p>This fold also identifies (at <b>Cx'dv</b>) the angle between the vanishing point <b>C</b> and the
            direction of view, so this folding down of an interior section of the perspective pyramid is geometrically
            identical to the folding of the viewpoint into the circle of view that is used to <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect3.html#rotatingvp">rotate vanishing points</a> to the
            direction of view.</p>

          <p>The second kind of folding operations are the <b>vanishing line folds</b> that define an <i>exterior
              angle</i> of one face of the perspective pyramid (angle <b>2</b>) as a "plan view" of the angle in the
            image plane (angle <b>2'</b>). This is the angle, on the face of the 3PP pyramid, between the edge of
            triangle <b>ABV</b> and its altitude <b>PV</b>. The fold is achieved by constructing a line (<b>ab</b>) that
            <b>intersects the direction of view parallel to the vanishing line</b> (<b>AB</b>). This line intersects the
            circle of view at <b>x'</b>. Because <b>Vdv</b> equals <b>x'dv</b>, the line <b>Px'</b> equals line
            <b>PV</b>, the altitude of <b>ABV</b>. Therefore an arc constructed on <b>P</b> with radius <b>Px'</b>
            intersects the auxiliary horizon line at <b>x</b>, and <b>Px</b> = <b>PV</b>. Therefore the right triangle
            <b>ABx</b> is the perpendicular view of the foreshortened triangle <b>ABV</b>, and <b>x</b> is the
            <b>auxiliary viewpoint</b> for the horizon line <b>AB</b>.</p>

          <p class="CC">three right triangles folded out of the 3PP pyramid</p>

          <p>The diagram (above) shows the three possible vanishing line folds and auxiliary viewpoints (<b>x</b>,
            <b>y</b> and <b>z</b>) constructed from a 3PP vanishing line triangle. Study this diagram carefully until
            you understand how each fold has been done.</p>

          <p>The geometry of triangles is efficient: defining any one side with its two adjacent angles, or any two
            sides with their common angle, defines the rest of the triangle. Therefore <b>only two folding operations
              are necessary</b> to define the image of a 3PP vanishing line triangle: one auxiliary horizon line fold
            and one vanishing line fold. This is sufficient to define the location of all three vanishing points and
            vanishing lines in relation to the direction of view and circle of view.</p>

          <p>Finally, the <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect4.html#3PPcanonical">3PP
              construction</a> releases the direction of view from its parallel position to the ground plane, and this
            creates several novel features in the perspective geometry which affect in particular the scaling of the 3PP
            drawing. For now I only want to describe this geometry and define a few new terms (diagram, below).<a

          <p>In this example we assume the perspective view is <i>downward</i> in relation to the ground plane: it can
            just as well be <i>upward</i> (as the top of a skyscraper viewed from the ground) or <i>tilted</i> (as a
            city viewed from a turning airplane), a problem I leave for the reader. In the downward view case:</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The <b>image plane is oblique to the ground plane</b>, as is the direction of view. As a result the
            direction of view does not terminate in a vanishing point, but in a <b>fixation point</b>, some physical
            point on the ground. This <b>fixation distance</b> is typically different from the <b>object distance</b>
            from the station point to the primary form.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The station point <b>S</b> is still directly under the viewpoint, but now the station point appears
            on the image plane, where it is the image <b>s</b> equivalent to the <i>vertical vanishing point</i>

          <p>•&nbsp;The horizon line is now located <i>above</i> the direction of view in the circle of view, which

            longer the same as the orthogonal vanishing point (at <b>h</b>), the vanishing point of ground plane
            recession.<a name="formula10">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The primary form appears in <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#foreshorten2">rotation foreshortening</a> — the
            vertical and horizontal dimensions are in a different scale. Foreshortening is corrected by using the

            other angle. However, it is sometimes useful to estimate the amount of <i>vertical</i> foreshortening, for

          <h3>constructing a 3PP drawing<br>(horizon line method)</h3>

          <p>The horizon line method builds on the assumption that most three dimensional perspective problems concern a
            viewer whose line of sight is not parallel to the ground plane. Either the viewer is looking upward, toward
            the top of a tower, building, mountain or cliff; or the viewer is looking downward, from a vantage at the
            top of a tower, building, mountain or cliff. <a name="approxmethod">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><span class="rubric1">Approximate Horizon Line Method</span>. In this approach the artist places the
            horizon line and vanishing points by judgment or whim, but uses the <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect4.html#pyramidfolds">pyramid folds</a> to make these
            landmarks consistent with each other.</p>

          <p>The first step is the placement of the horizon line in relation to the principal point: either above (for a
            downward direction of view) or below (for an upward direction of view). Then, using a drafting triangle, the
            artist finds the 90° angle at one of the diagonal vanishing points, and extends this line until it meets the
            median line below the circle of view: this is the vertical vanishing point (<b>vp<sub>1</sub></b>).<a
              name="ahstep1">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec7b.gif" width="311"
              height="413"></p>
          <p class="CC">three point perspective: rotating the horizon line</p>

          <p>It is useful to bisect this angle to <b>find the diagonal view</b> (45° from either the horizon line or
            <b>vp<sub>1</sub></b> visual rays), as this projects in depth the viewing height above the ground plane.</p>

          <p>Next the second vanishing point (<b>vp<sub>2</sub></b>) is located on the horizon line somewhere to the
            left of the median line. A ruler laid from <b>dv</b> to this point will show the angle to view of a cubic
            form in perspective space at the direction of view. <a name="ahstep2">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec7c.gif" width="322"
              height="389"></p>
          <p class="CC">three point perspective: approximately placing vp<sub>2</sub></p>

          <p>Once the location of the point is completed, draw the <i>vanishing line</i> between the two vanishing
            points. Then you must construct a perpendicular line from this vanishing line through the direction of view
            (<b>dv</b>), as <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/construct.html#perpendicular">described here</a>.</p>

          <p>The steps are: (1) draw a circular arc around <b>dv</b> that intersects the vanishing line at two widely
            spaced points, <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>; (2) draw an arc from each point with a radius greater than half the
            segment length between them; (3) draw a line through the double intersection of the arcs to define the
            normal point <b>c</b>; (4) draw a line from <b>c</b> through <b>dv</b> until it intersects the horizon line
            on the opposite side of the circle of view. This is the auxiliary horizon line for the constructed vanishing
            line; it locates <b>vp<sub>3</sub></b>.<a name="ahstep3">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec7d.gif" width="336"
              height="406"></p>
          <p class="CC">three point perspective: completed "approximate" perspective triangle</p>

          <p>Construct the third vanishing line and its auxiliary horizon line from <b>vp<sub>2</sub></b> through
            <b>dv</b>.</p>

          <p>Find the internal or external altitude points on the auxiliary horizon lines, and from these locate the six
            measure points on the vanishing lines. (The diagram above shows one internal altitude point, <b>h'</b> and
            the two measure points constructed from it.) This completes the three point perspective triangle.<a
              name="exactmethod">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><span class="rubric1">Exact Horizon Line Method</span>. In some cases (illustrated below) it is desirable
            to locate the three vanishing points precisely. In this case the pyramid folds are precisely defined with a
            protractor or using the <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/trigs.html">tangent ratio</a>
            for the required angle, applied to the radius length of the circle of view that is perpendicular to the
            viewpoint.</p>

          <p>Required is one <i>auxiliary horizon line fold</i> along the vertical auxiliary horizon line (median line)
            to establish the tilt of the horizon line and the location of the vertical vanishing point
            (<b>vp<sub>1</sub></b>), and one <i>vanishing line fold</i> along the horizon line to establish the
            left/right placement of <b>vp<sub>2</sub></b> and <b>vp<sub>2</sub></b>.</p>

          <p>The diagram (below) shows these operations to provide an exact 25° downward angle of view to the ground
            plane (upward horizon angle of 25°), and a placement of <b>vp<sub>2</sub></b> 55° to the left of the median
            line. This places <b>vp<sub>3</sub></b> 35° to the right of the median line.<a name="ehstep1">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec7e.gif" width="356"

          <p class="CC">three point perspective: exact rotation of vanishing points</p>

          <p>The vanishing lines are added as before; the auxiliary vanishing lines can be drawn directly, as lines from
            the vanishing points through <b>dv</b> to the opposite vanishing line, because the vanishing points have
            already been precisely located.</p>

          <p>Measure points have been added using the "alternative" horizon line method <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect4.html#altmeasurepoints">described above</a>.<a

          <p class="CC">three point perspective: completed "exact" perspective triangle</p>

          <p>Although this 3PP triangle is very similar to the one constructed from an approximate judgment of the
            correct angles, here all the perspective landmarks are exactly placed from given values established in
            advance. This is especially important when the goal is a 3PP view of a specific primary form from a specific
            location — as is typical in architectural renderings or historical reconstructions — or when a certain
            arrangement of key forms within the image is required.</p>

          <p><span class="rubric1">Diagonal Vanishing Points</span>. It is usually very useful to take the extra step
            and establish the diagonal vanishing points on the horizon line. Once this is done a unit dimension on the
            station line can be projected across the ground plane, using the method of projecting a <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#unitdepth">unit dimension in depth</a> from the
            diagonal vanishing points.<a name="ehstep3">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec7g.gif" width="314"
              height="486"></p>
          <p class="CC">three point perspective: locating the central dvp's</p>

          <p>In fact, no separate rotation is required to define the diagonal vanishing points from the auxiliary
            viewpoint: they are already located at the intersection of the arc used to define the auxiliary viewpoint
            with the horizon line (diagram, above). The method of rotating the diagonal vanishing points around the
            auxiliary viewpoint <b>A</b>, so that a 90° angle is bisected by the vertical auxiliary horizon line (median
            line), is shown simply to confirm this.</p>

          <p>Once these diagonal vanishing points have been established, <b>ovp</b> serves as the <i>orthogonal
              vanishing point,</i> the convergence for recession in depth parallel to the ground plane (the <i>ground
              plane</i> central recession); but <b>dv</b> remains the <i>principal point,</i> the convergence for
            recession parallel to the direction of view (the <i>viewer's</i> central recession). The depth of
            transversals across orthogonals to <b>ovp</b> are found by diagonals to <b>dvp<sub>1</sub></b> and
            <b>dvp<sub>2</sub></b>; the depth of transversals across orthogonals to <b>dv</b> are found by vanishing
            lines to points on the circle of view.<a name="drawingscale">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><span class="rubric1">Scaling the 3PP Drawing</span>. This task is more complex than it is in one or two
            point perspective, but I outline it here because I have not seen it discussed in any other source. A minimal
            reliance on trigonometry is required, both to validate the basic principles and to provide calculation
            shortcuts or remedies to complex construction problems.</p>

          <p><b>Construction Methods</b>. Three drawing scale guides are already available: (1) the circle of view and
            the many <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#formula6">visual angles</a>
            that can be computed within it; (2) the <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect4.html#ehstep1">viewing height in depth</a>, added when the
            horizon line was rotated; and (3) a <b>ground line scale</b>, which is used in combination with the
            orthogonal vanishing point (<b>ovp</b>) to project a <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#unitdepth">unit dimension in depth</a> to
            approximately locate objects in depth and scale their image size. Provided image scale and perspective
            accuracy are not critically important, these are almost always adequate to scale the 3PP drawing.<a
              name="ehstep4">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec7h.gif" width="366"
              height="395"></p>
          <p class="CC">three point perspective: ground plane recession</p>

          <p>Two scaling approaches can be used. In the first example (above), an arbitrary unit dimension of 50&nbsp;cm
            measured along the station line image is projected into perspective space by orthogonals drawn to the
            orthogonal vanishing point (<b>ovp</b>). These indicate that the viewing height in depth is about 7.2 times
            the viewing height (measured from the station line) and that the fixation point is about 16 units away.</p>

          <p>Dividing the viewing height by the depth units yields the ground plane width of the unit dimension. If the
            viewing height is 300&nbsp;meters, then the unit dimension represents about 300/7.2 = 42&nbsp;meters, and
            the fixation point is about 672&nbsp;meters from the station line — all distances measured <i>on the ground
              plane</i> rather than along the line of sight. If the viewing height is 3&nbsp;feet, then the unit
            dimension represents 36/7.2 = 5&nbsp;inches and the fixation point is 80&nbsp;inches away.</p>

          <p>The orthogonals define this unit dimension at any depth; a transversal established at the base of the
            primary form creates a measure bar in unit dimensions at that distance. In the diagram (above), a measure
            bar is shown at the fixation point that is 3 unit dimensions long. If the viewing height is 300&nbsp;meters,
            then the measure bar defines a width of 126&nbsp;meters at a distance of 672&nbsp;meters. This image bar is
            used to measure out the size of the primary form image along and above the base transversal.<a
              name="ehstep5">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec7i.gif" width="367"
              height="396"></p>
          <p class="CC">three point perspective: key scaling dimensions</p>

          <p>The second method is to establish an exact unit dimension. This is done by (1) drawing a line from one of
            the <b>dvp's</b> through the <i>viewing height in depth</i> (<b>vhd</b>) and extending this line until it
            intersects the station line image, then (2) dividing the distance from this intersection to the station
            point (<b>vp<sub>1</sub></b>) by an appropriate number of units. In the example this procedure yields a
            station line length of 354&nbsp;cm, which is conveniently divided into six 59&nbsp;cm units. If the viewing
            height is 270&nbsp;meters, then this unit dimension represents exactly 45&nbsp;meters on the ground plane.
          </p>

          <p>As explained in the discussion of <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#drawingscale">scaling the drawing</a> in the 1PP
            context, the location of the format requires the artist to decide the appropriate size and location of the
            primary form image. The principal scaling restriction is the <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#horizon">horizon line rule</a>: the horizon line
            intersects all forms at a height above their intersection with the ground plane that is equal to the viewing
            height, or causes the forms to appear below the horizon line by an equivalent added proportion of their
            total height. Following the procedure explained for central perspective, the artist <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#scalingsteps">finds the ratio</a> between the
            viewing height and object height, then places the object so that the horizon line divides or stands above
            the object image by this ratio. This rule holds regardless of the angle of the direction of view to the
            ground plane.</p>

          <p>In the example I will develop, I want to render a primary form that is 300&nbsp;meters high and
            125&nbsp;meters wide. I want the upper portion of the form to cut the horizon line, so that its top portion
            is silhouetted against the sky. Therefore I plan on approximately 30&nbsp;meters of the form appearing above
            the horizon line and the remaining 270&nbsp;meters below the horizon line. This means the <b>viewing
              height</b> will also be 270&nbsp;meters (according to the <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#horizon">horizon height rule</a>), and 30/300 or 10%
            of the primary form image will be above the horizon line.</p>

          <p>To minimize perspective distortion and create a "long view" image of the primary form, I decide to use the
            fixation point as the anchor point. The 13th unit transversal is just behind the fixation line (orange),
            which indicates an object distance (on the ground plane) of less than 585&nbsp;meters. Now the
            <i>horizontal</i> unit dimension can be derived directly from the orthogonals along that transversal, then
            rotated 90° to provide the <i>vertical</i> image dimensions. Then the approximate image area of the primary
            form can be defined within the circle of view (green rectangle).</p>

          <p>Finally, the format dimensions are positioned around the primary form area, horizon line, direction of
            view, or any other important composition elements. This can be done first, and the primary form fitted
            within the format, or done after the primary form is located within the circle of view. (Either way, the
            format dimensions are established as a proportion of the circle of view radius, as <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#scalingsteps">explained here</a>.) Given my angle of
            view and the monumental size of the primary form, I decide on a large format. The example shown below is the
            29"x42" (74&nbsp;cm x 107&nbsp;cm) double elephant (USA) format, in "portrait" orientation and positioned to
            accommodate the primary form above and below the horizon line (yellow rectangle).</p>

          <p>Comment: if you compare the perspective gradients in the previous two diagrams to the perspective gradient
            in <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#textures">central perspective</a>,
            the recession appears more gentle in 3PP — the squares at the base of the circle of view are still
            vertically elongated in 3PP, but are horizontally elongated in 1PP. This is because the ground plane is
            viewed at a more oblique angle and is therefore less foreshortened (at the station point or
            <b>vp<sub>1</sub></b>, the view is perpendicular to the ground plane, as indicated by the shoe prints). But
            in the visual area above the location of the viewing height in depth, the two gradients become equivalent.
          </p>

          <p><b>Calculation Methods</b>. The alternative scaling method uses calculation rather than approximate
            construction. This method is more precise and robust. The diagram below identifies the key scaling terms in
            relation to the elevation view of the image plane and visual rays from the viewpoint, and the image plane as
            it appears in the perspective diagrams.<a name="ehstep6">&nbsp;</a></p>

            horizon angle; <b>h</b>&nbsp;= orthogonal vanishing point (horizon line); <b>p</b>&nbsp;= principal point
            (fixation line); <b>z</b>&nbsp;= viewing height in depth; <b>s</b>&nbsp;= image station point (station line

          </p>

          <p>The only preparation necessary for these calculations is specification of (1) the viewing height, (2)
            viewing distance perpendicular to the image plane, and (3) horizon angle. Continuing the example above, I
            set the viewing height at 270&nbsp; meters, the viewing distance at 1.5&nbsp;m (150&nbsp;cm) and the horizon
            angle at 25°.</p>

          <p>In addition, you will need a pocket calculator that can provide the three <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/trigs.html">trigonometric functions</a> (sine, cosine and tangent)
            for any <b>horizon angle</b>. In the example, the horizon angle is 25°, therefore:</p>

          <p class="CC">sine(25°) = 0.423<br>
            cosine(25°) = 0.906<br>
            tangent(25°) = 0.466</p>

          <p><u>Format Dimensions</u>. The procedure for establishing the format dimensions is <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#scalingsteps">explained here</a>. It is useful to do
            this first, if an appropriate format size can be decided in advance, as this provides a frame of reference
            for other scaling decisions. I will continue with the double elephant example illustrated <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect4.html#ehstep5">above</a>.</p>

          <p><u>Ground Scale</u>. The second step is to establish the <b>ground scale</b>, the scale of the station line
            <b>S</b> on image plane at <b>s</b> (refer to the <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect4.html#3PPelevation">diagram above</a>):</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The "level line" role of the horizon line is taken by a <b>fixation line</b> through the direction
            of view and parallel to the horizon line above or below it. This defines the vanishing line for all planes
            parallel to the direction of view and to the horizon line (perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule15">rule&nbsp;15</a>), and the "actual size"
            image scale (at a viewing distance of 150&nbsp;cm, the circle of view radius along the fixation line is
            150&nbsp;cm).</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The <b>horizon height</b>, the distance of the horizon line above the fixation line as measured on
            the image plane, is equal to the viewing distance <i>multiplied by</i> the tangent of the horizon angle
            <b>&#952;</b>. The tangent of a 25° horizon angle is 0.466, so the horizon line is 150&nbsp;cm*0.466 =
            70&nbsp;cm above the direction of view.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The <i>station line image</i> is exactly below the viewpoint <b>v</b>, at point <b>s</b>, which
            defines the right triangle <b>vps</b> (because the direction of view is perpendicular to the image plane).
            Therefore the <b>station line distance</b> (the distance of image plane below the viewpoint, or <b>vs</b>)
            is the hypotenuse of the right triangle <b>vps</b>. This is equal to the viewing distance <i>divided by</i>
            the sine of the horizon angle, or 150&nbsp;cm/0.423 = 355&nbsp;cm.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The <b>ground image height</b> is the extent of the image plane between the horizon line and station
            line image, or the hypotenuse of the right triangle <b>hvs</b>. This is found as the station line distance
            <i>divided by</i> the cosine of the horizon angle: 355&nbsp;cm/0.906 = 392&nbsp;cm.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The station line image is below the fixation line at a distance <i>on the image plane</i> equal to
            <b>ps</b>, or the ground image height (<b>hs</b>) minus the horizon height (<b>hp</b>): 392&nbsp;cm –
            70&nbsp;cm = 322&nbsp;cm.
            <a name="formula11">&nbsp;</a>
          </p>

          <p>•&nbsp;Finally, <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#formula5">formula&nbsp;5</a> provides the image
            ratio for the station line scale. If the viewing height is 270 meters and the station line distance is
            355&nbsp;cm, then the station line <i>image scale</i> is 3.55&nbsp;m/270cm = 1.31%; or equivalently, a 1
            centimeter unit dimension in the station line equals 270/3.55 = 76&nbsp;cm on the ground plane. To obtain
            the 45&nbsp;meter unit dimension in the ground plane as units of the image plane at the station line:
            45*0.0131&nbsp;m = 59&nbsp;cm unit dimension in the station line. This is the <b>ground&nbsp;scale</b>, as
            summarized in the following formulas:</p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/3PPscale.gif" width="380" height="99">
          </p>

          <p>where the <i>ground unit</i> is whatever measurement unit is convenient for mapping objects on the ground
            plane (e.g., 1&nbsp;meter or 100&nbsp;meters), and the viewing distance, station line distance and viewing
            height are all measured in the same units.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;Finally, the diagonal vanishing points can be used to project the ground scale unit dimension in
            depth. The diagram (above) shows that the 270&nbsp;meter line established by the projecting the
            45&nbsp;meter unit dimension in depth exactly coincides with the location of the viewing height projected in
            depth by the horizon plane rotation.</p>

          <p><u>Fixation Line Scale</u>. The third and last step is to determine the image depth <b>z</b> on the image
            plane for an object on the ground plane at distance <b>X</b> from the station line, or the object distance
            <b>X</b> on the ground plane of a particular image depth <b>z</b> on the image plane. These relationships
            are defined in the following formulas:<a name="formula14">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/3PPdepth.gif" width="380"

          <p class="CC">three point perspective: anchor point and anchor line</p>

          <p>The image plane extends from the image station line (<b>s</b>) to the horizon line (<b>h</b>), defining the
            <b>horizon height</b> (<b>sh</b>). This image plane can be duplicated by a secondary image plane <b>Sx</b>,
            some distance in front of and parallel to it. The secondary plane intersects the horizon line at <b>x</b>,
            removed from the viewpoint <b>V</b> by the <b>offset distance</b> <b>O</b>, and intersects the ground plane
            at the station line (<b>S</b>), which is a zero horizontal distance from the viewpoint. These intersections
            are identical with the image points <b>h</b> and <b>s</b>, so the horizon height <b>sh</b> is the image of
            the physical distance <b>Sx</b> when the object distance (on the ground plane) is zero.</p>

          <p>Moving the secondary plane forward by the object distance <b>X</b> relocates the ground intersection to
            <b>S'</b> and the horizon line intersection at <b>x'</b>, so that the image of <b>S'x'</b> is now <b>zh</b>
            — the image point <b>z</b> is at an <b>image depth</b> (<b>zh</b>) below the horizon line. In this new
            arrangement, the triangular proportions define the proportional equality:</p>

          <p class="CC">zh/sh = xV/x'V = OD/(X+OD)</p>

          <p>which solves either for (16) the image depth (<b>zh</b>) or (17) the ground plane object distance
            (<b>X</b>) by algebraic rearrangement.</p>

          <p>Using these formulas, we establish (for a horizon angle of 25°, a viewing height of 270&nbsp;m and a
            viewing distance of 1.5&nbsp;m) that:</p>

          <p>(8) <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#formatscale">format scale</a> =
            25%(W), 36%(H)<br>
            (11) horizon height = 70&nbsp;cm<br>
            (11) station line distance = 355&nbsp;cm<br>
            (13) ground scale: 66&nbsp;cm = 50&nbsp;meters<br>
            (14) offset distance = 126&nbsp;m<br>
            (15) ground image height = 392&nbsp;cm<br>
            (16) image depth (of <i>fixation line</i>) = 70&nbsp;cm<br>
            (16) image depth (of <i>viewing distance in depth</i>) = 125&nbsp;cm<br>
            (16) image depth (of <i>format baseline @ 500&nbsp;m</i>) = 79&nbsp;cm<br>
            (17) object distance (at fixation line) = 579&nbsp;m.</p>

          <p><u>Anchor Line and Anchor Point</u>. Given the fixation point as the anchor point, the ground plane object
            distance is 579&nbsp;meters at a viewing height of 270&nbsp;meters, which is a <i>diagonal object
              distance</i> of 639 meters to the base of the primary form. So the <b>fixation line scale</b> (derived
            from <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#formula5">formula&nbsp;5</a>) is:
          </p>

          <p>(18) image scale (at <i>fixation line</i>) = 1.5/[579<sup>2</sup>+270<sup>2</sup>]<sup>1/2</sup><br>=
            1.5/639&nbsp;m<br>= 0.00235 (0.235%)</p>

          <p>To go from image plane units to ground plane units (at the fixation line), you divide by the image scale
            factor:
          </p>
          <p align="center">
            1&nbsp;cm = 1&nbsp;cm/0.00235 = 4.26&nbsp;m.</p>

          <p>To go from ground plane units to image plane units, you multiply by the image scale factor. Thus, an object
            125 meters wide and 301 meters tall, oriented parallel to the image plane, creates the image dimensions</p>

          <p class="CC">125&nbsp;m*0.00235 = 0.294&nbsp;m = 29.4&nbsp;cm<br>
            301&nbsp;m*0.00235 = 0.707&nbsp;m = 70.7&nbsp;cm.</p>

          <p>These are the <b>measure bar dimensions</b> for the image at the anchor point (established as the fixation
            point), as shown in the diagram (below).<a name="ehstep8">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec7j.gif" width="375"

          <p class="CC">three point perspective: anchor point and anchor line</p>

          <p>Confusion about the choice of vanishing line measure points and the orientation of measure bars (for cubic
            forms) is usually dispelled by the following three criteria:</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The measure point to use for any edge is the measure point <b>defined by an arc from the controlling
              vanishing point</b>. Thus, the height dimension is controlled by the vertical vanishing point
            (<b>vp<sub>1</sub></b>), which was the center of the arc used to define <b>mp<sub>2</sub></b> and
            <b>mp<sub>5</sub></b>.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The controlling vanishing point is the <b>vanishing point for the convergence of the edges</b> that
            are being sized by the measure bar. Thus, the left side edges of a plan in the ground plane are defined by
            the lefthand horizon vanishing point.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The measure bar is <b>always oriented parallel to the vanishing line</b> containing the measure
            point.</p>

          <p class="subCC">diagram enlarged to 60° circle of view for clarity</p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>It is usually convenient to establish the plan or "street map" dimensions of the drawing first, as the plan
            outlines do not intersect one another and clearly establishe the front to back ordering of large forms. Here
            the drawing is being constructed from the elevation only, as the base is square. Only the 60° circle of view
            is shown for clarity.</p>

          <p>Using the measure point guidelines (above), the controlling vanishing point for the right side of the base
            of the tower is <b>vp<sub>3</sub></b>; and this vanishing point defined the arc for <b>mp<sub>3</sub></b>
            (refer to the <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect4.html#ahstep3">diagram
              above</a>). The controlling vanishing point for the height of the tower is the vertical vanishing point,
            <b>vp<sub>1</sub></b>; and this vanishing point defined the arc for <b>mp<sub>2</sub></b>.</p>

          <p>The fixation line measure bar is used to establish the base width of 125 meters, and this dimension is
            projected in depth by the lines to the opposite measure points <b>mp<sub>3</sub></b> and
            <b>mp<sub>4</sub></b>. The measure bar is parallel to the vanishing line containing the measure points, Then
            vanishing lines from the anchor point to <b>vp<sub>2</sub></b> and <b>vp<sub>3</sub></b> establish the sides
            of the plan.</p>

          <p>The tower is symmetrical on its four sides, but the sides are not vertical: they define an exponential
            function designed to maximize the tower's strength against strong winds. To facilitate the perspective
            construction we have to find the central axis, which is simply the intersection of the diagonals of the
            plan.<a name="ehstep10">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ three point perspective 4_files/perspec7l.gif" width="380"

          <p class="subCC">diagram enlarged to 60° circle of view for clarity</p>

          <p>The major stages of the tower are marked off on a vertical measure bar, this bar is rotated to be parallel
            with the vanishing line of the appropriate measure point, and the tower stages are projected onto a vertical
            axis.</p>

          <p>Two strategies are available. The existing elevation drawing can be used to create the measure bar: this
            drawing is in the image scale defined by the anchor point on the fixation line, 579&nbsp;meters from the
            viewpoint. Elevation points are projected onto a vertical line constructed from the anchor point. These
            elevation points are the front corners of new squares, of equal size as the base of the tower, containing
            the tower platforms. These are constructed "scaffold style", by vertical lines from the four corners of the
            plan. At each level the scaffold squares are recessed to the side vanishing points from the front corner,
            and the diagonal found as before. Then the plan of the tower platform is constructed within this square, its
            four corners along the diagonals.</p>

          <p>The alternative method is to project the elevation points onto the central axis, and project the tower
            platforms out from these central points. This method is also shown in the diagram: the measure bar must be
            anchored at the base of the central axis. Note however that this point is over 80&nbsp;meters farther away
            from the viewpoint than the front corner (as shown by the 50&nbsp;meter distance transversals in the ground
            plan), therefore the measure bar must be sized, using <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect4.html#formula14">formula&nbsp;18</a>, to the new image
            distance. First the added distance is derived from the whole diagonal, which is then aligned to the
            direction of view by the cosine correction:</p>

          <p>base diagonal = [125<sup>2</sup>+125<sup>2</sup>]<sup>1/2</sup> = 177&nbsp;m<br>
            half diagonal = 177&nbsp;m/2 = 88.5&nbsp;m<br>
            ground plane distance = 88.5&nbsp;m * cosine(10°) = 80.2</p>

          <p>and the new ground plane distance (579+80 = 659) is used to compute the new image scale:</p>

          <p>(18) image scale (at <i>central axis</i>) = 1.5/[659<sup>2</sup>+270<sup>2</sup>]<sup>1/2</sup><br>=
            1.5/712&nbsp;m<br>= 0.00211 (0.211%)</p>

          <p>(Note that the central axis distance could be estimated from its position just beyond the 650&nbsp;m
            transversal distance line.) Once the major external points of the tower profile are established, the outside
            curves of the tower can be drawn with a French curve or freehand, and details of the tower filled in as
