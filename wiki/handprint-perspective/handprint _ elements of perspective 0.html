          <h2>elements of perspective</h2>

          <p><i>This page and the pages linked to it comprise the most extensive treatment of linear perspective
              available online, and one of the most comprehensive tutorials available in any textbook currently in
              print. This revised edition posted on 01/2023. My thanks to the many readers who offered corrections and
              constructive comments.</i></p>

          <p>The technique of <b>linear perspective</b> allows artists to simulate or construct the appearance of three
            dimensional space on a two dimensional surface. It is one of the major innovations of European art, with an
            extraordinary impact on western visual culture from the 15th to the 19th centuries.</p>

          <p>Linear perspective originated as the artist's slide rule or abacus, a method of calculation through the
            rule based use of physical tools. Those methods have been replaced by film or digital photography, <a
              class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/tech08.html#tracing"><b>opaque projectors</b></a>, and
            computer assisted design and animation software. But linear perspective lives on primarily in art historical
            monographs, architectural visualizations and the freewheeling digital mayhem of <i>Grand Theft Auto.</i></p>

          <p>So why bother with it? Because knowledge of perspective greatly enhances your perceptive skills and your
            understanding of light and space. It attunes you to spatial recession as the power line of visual design. It
            is a reliable guide to drawing in all situations, and a fascinating case study of the ways that a painting
            is shaped by purely conceptual considerations. It is also indispensable to understand the design problems
            that inspired and challenged artists of the past.</p>

          <p>Although the Greeks and Romans drew foreshortened limbs and architectural forms, the geometrical methods
            necessary to construct a consistent illusion of spatial depth across the entire picture plane were first
            developed and used by 15th century Florentine artists with strong mathematical skills: the visionary
            architect <b>Filippo&nbsp;Brunelleschi</b> (1377-1446) and the humanist scholar <b>Leon Battista Alberti</b>
            (1404-1472). They systematized the Tuscan workshop methods of <b>pseudoperspective</b> or near perspective
            which were already on display in frescos by Giotto and Duccio. It's interesting that technically advanced
            northern Italians were working out the geometry of linear perspective at about the same time that optically
            sophisticated artists in the Low Countries were adopting <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/tech08.html#notnewidea"><b>projection devices</b></a> to create
            more realistic pictures. Perspective was just one aspect of a new artistic realism that was created by many
            practitioners in separate regions of Europe.</p>

          <p>In 1435 Alberti wrote the Latin manuscript <i>De Pictura</i> (On Painting), which he revised and translated
            into Italian as <i>Della Pittura</i> in 1436. This was the first book to describe <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#historical"><b>perspective methods</b></a> as part
            of the overall design of a painting, and within a century artists such as Piero della Francesca (c.1470) and
            Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1490) in Italy, Albrecht Dürer (1525) in Germany and the architect Jean Pélerin (1505)
            in France wrote more ambitious perspective studies. During the 16th and 17th centuries linear perspective
            diffused across Europe and was honed through the analysis of specific representational problems, in
            particular foreshortened human figures, the visualization of intricate geometrical solids (often realized as
            engravings or as inlaid wood designs called <i>intarsa</i>), architectural scenery for plays and operas,
            frescos representing great spatial depth, and anamorphic projections (which appear "normal" from an oblique
            angle of view, or when viewed in a curved mirror). In the 17th century these refined LP methods were
            absorbed into and thoroughly grounded by the science of projective geometry, and analytical geometricians
            began to investigate perspective issues unrelated to any artistic practice.</p>

          <p>No matter: artists continued using perspective in a variety of innovative ways, developing practical
            shortcuts for constructing perspective drawings, and refining the perspective rendering of architectural
            forms in combination with the <b>free perspective</b> representation of figures and objects. By the 18th
            century perspective was ensconced as a core study in art academies, which transformed perspective techniques
            into a mechanical orthodoxy that contributed to the extinction of strict perspective styles of painting.
            Early 19th century artists such as <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/artist05.html"><b>J.M.W. Turner</b></a> made interesting
            explorations in optical color mixing and aerial perspective, preparing a complete break from perspective
            traditions late in the 19th&nbsp;century.<a name="glass"></a></p>

          <p>In the traditional account, Brunelleschi either discovered or verified linear perspective by literally
            <b>painting views of buildings onto a mirror</b> or windowpane. This "draw on glass" approach was probably
            not the method Brunelleschi actually used, but it fits well with the idea that a perspective painting is
            <b>a mirror or window view of the world</b>, and it soon became the standard way to convince drawing
            students that perspective really works, even when the scope of the problem is no bigger than a table top.

          <p>Want to try it? Punch a small hole in an index card, staple or tape the card to one end of a wood
            yardstick, then tape the other end of the yardstick to the back of a chair, so that the hole in the card is
            at your eye level as you straddle the chair. Put the chair in front of a large window, sit, and look through
            the hole in the card with one eye. Use an erasable marker pen or grease pencil to draw on the glass the
            buildings or objects in view, then hold a white paper behind the glass to see your finished design. As you
            draw, you may notice that this procedure feels confining. That's because it is — illustrating how far the
            assumptions of perspective differ from our fluid, constantly changing visual experience.<a

          <p class="CC">a renaissance perspective machine</p>
          <p class="subCC">from Albrecht Dürer, <i>Underweysung der Messung mit Zirckel und Richtscheyt&nbsp;...</i>
            [Instruction How to Measure with Compass and Straight Edge&nbsp;...] (1525)</p>

          <p>This peephole or "peep show" tracing method does not make clear that linear perspective is really created
            by <b>straight lines passing through a vertical plane</b>. For that, the perspective "machine" (diagram,
            above) by the German artist <b>Albrecht Dürer</b> (1471-1528) is a better example. By looping a weighted
            string through an eye ring in the wall, one artist could hold the opposite end along the contours of a lute;
            a second artist could measure the height and horizontal position of the string where it passed through a
            rectangular frame, then transfer this point to a paper or canvas (shown as a hinged panel). By repeating the
            measurements dozens or hundreds of times, a "connect the dots" perspective view of the three dimensional
            lute could be constructed on a two dimensional surface. Through similar empirical methods, Renaissance
            artists worked out the geometric fundamentals of perspective technique.<a name="pointofview">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p>Dürer's machine demonstrates that linear perspective <b>explicitly depends on a single point of view in
              space</b>. A perspective drawing of a building or landscape reveals the location, vantage and orientation
            of the viewer as precisely as it shows the physical form of the objects in view. The eye ring (diagram,
            above) represents the eye of the viewer or <b>center of projection</b>; the stretched string represents the
            straight beams of light or <b>visual rays</b> that converge on the eye from all objects in the field of
            view; the hinged surface is the artist's canvas or <b>image plane</b>. Everything comes down to that point
            of view defined by the wall ring or hole in index card: <b>the point of view, not objects in space, is the
              fundamental perspective theme</b>.</p>

          <p>Linear perspective is fundamentally a <b>geometrical method</b>, not a mathematical one — which means
            <i>you draw, you don't calculate.</i> All you need are the standard construction tools from high school
            geometry: a straight edge (ruler), pencil and a compass (or a long strip of cardboard and some push pins).
            Unfortunately, these tools are awkward to use when the perspective view is extreme or the drawing is very
            large, and they make quantitative discussion of perspective issues difficult. So I explain numerical
            calculations, reduced drawings and other tricks that can help you through those problems. But calculations
            are not necessary to apply LP methods.</p>

          <p>There is a sprawling and stale literature on linear perspective, but two points deserve mention. As James
            Elkins and Martin Kemp point out, the historical uses of perspective construction have always been
            opportunistic and evolving. Many seemingly "obedient" perspective paintings reveal, on closer examination,
            "fuzzy" or multiple vanishing points — some objects in the image are "in perspective" and other objects are
            not. Most artists chose to make "corrections" to apparently inconsistent <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#distortion"><b>perspective distortions</b></a>,
            often in pursuit of a more pleasing finished composition: linear perspective often creates as many design
            problems as design solutions. In that limited sense, LP is not any better or worse for making "realistic"
            images than the various types of parallel or <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect5.html#paraline"><b>paraline perspectives</b></a> used by
            architects and engineers — elevation, section and plan, or military, isometric and dimetric projections. In
            all these, similar distortions appear and are easily ignored. The moral is that <b>perspective must be used
              gently</b>: it is a very cool drawing tool and a compelling representational convention, not the ultimate
            code of drawing correctness.</p>

          <p>The best approach is to rely on LP to lay out basic proportions and shapes, to clarify difficult drawing
            problems, and to guide your intuitions about forms and textures in space. Freehand perspective and trust in
            your visual judgment should not be pushed aside, but nourished and exercised by the insights linear
            perspective can provide. As Vasari wrote of Michelangelo, "he held his compasses, that is to say his
            judgment, in his eyes and not his hands."</p>

          <p>I've divided these diverse materials into separate pages, and occasionally use nonstandard terminology in
            the interest of clarity. I hope to provide a practical and provocative reference to the topic.<a
              name="references">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p class="smalltext"><span class="rubric">References</span>. There are many books on linear perspective, and
            they are wildly uneven in quality and practicality. For beginners, <b>Perspective Made Easy</b> by Ernest
            Norling (Norton, 1967), first published in 1939, provides a very lucid, entertaining and highly practical
            general introduction. John Raynes's <b>A Complete Guide to Perspective</b> (Collins &amp; Brown, 2005)
            introduces perspective problems through an attractive selection of photographs and diagrams, but is rather
            informal about construction solutions, especially for shadows and reflections. The discussion in
            <b>Perspective for Artists</b> by Rex Vicat Cole (Norton, 1976) is a more extensive and practical
            presentation, though somewhat out of date. The most comprehensive practical instructions, tailored to the
            tools and methods of architects and draftsmen, can be found in <b>Perspective Drawing: A Step-by-Step
              Handbook</b> by Michael E. Helms (Prentice Hall, 1997), available as a facsimile reprint. Another useful
            though occasionally inaccurate guide is <b>Perspective: From Basic to Creative</b> by Robert W. Gill (Thames
            &amp; Hudson, 2006). The elegant "circle of view" approach adopted here is based on <b>Linear Perspective:
              Its History, Directions for Construction, and Aspects in the Environment and in the Fine Arts</b> by Willy
            Bärtschi (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1981), regrettably now out of print but probably too formal for most
            artists.</p>

          <p class="smalltext">The following sources expand on the historical and artistic context for perspective
            techniques. <b>The Science of Art</b> by Martin Kemp (Yale University Press, 1990) is a careful study of the
            historical development and use of linear perspective. <b>The Poetics of Perspective</b> by James Elkins
            (Cornell University Press, 1994) is a stimulating if academic study of the development and artistic impact
            of perspective techniques from the early Renaissance to early Baroque. E.H. Gombrich's classic <b>Art and
              Illusion</b> (Princeton University Press, 1960) is the most articulate defense of linear perspective as an
            accurate description of the visual world. On that theme, <b>Optics, Painting and Photography</b> by M.H.
            Pirenne (Cambridge University Press, 1970) experimentally (and with clear photographic examples) explores
            and confirms the accuracy and limitations of perspective as a description of natural human vision. The most
            famous dissenting view is Erwin Panofsky's <b>Perspective as Symbolic Form</b> (1924; Zone Books, 1997),
            treacherous for the uninformed but an amusement for adepts. There are also many web pages devoted to
            perspective, most of them useless; start with the online translation of Alberti's <i><a class="index2"
                href="http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Alberti/"><b>Della Pittura</b></a>,</i> which is available in
            paperback from Penguin Books. There are many books describing perspective for use in CAD programs, which are
            less useful for a painter.<a name="index">&nbsp;</a></p>
