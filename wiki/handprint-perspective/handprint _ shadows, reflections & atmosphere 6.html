          <h2>shadows, reflections &amp; atmosphere</h2>

          <p>The geometry of natural (solar) shadows is one of the most complex perspective constructions because of the
            many possible arrangements of light source, shadow casting edge and shadow receiving surface in relation to
            the viewpoint. The <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#shadowform">basic
              rules of perspective shadows</a> explains the consistent features — the light plane and surface plane —
            that define all shadows.</p>

              light</a> can be classified into nine types, depending on the orientation of the shadow casting edge and
            shadow receiving plane. These shadow types provide the foundation for constructing <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#locallights">shadows from local lights</a>, such as
            outdoor and interior lighting fixtures.</p>

          <p><a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#reflections">Reflections</a> create
            complex perspective problems, especially if the reflecting surface is curved. I explain plane reflections —
            as from a mirror, or the surface of a large body of water — and briefly describe the reflections from
            rippling water and curved reflecting surfaces such as a metallic globe.</p>

          <p>One of the earliest criticisms of linear perspective, found in Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, was of its
            inability to account for the atmospheric effects of clouds, haze and smoke. I clear up the geometry of <a

          <p>Finally, <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#rainbows">rainbows </a> were
            among the great preoccupations of Romantic era landscape painters, especially in Germany and England. As

          <h3>basic rules of perspective shadows</h3>

          <p>Whenever you start the perspective analysis of a shadow, it is always helpful to consider the six factors
            that will determine the shadow's shape and appearance:</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;the <b>location of the light source</b> in relation to the shadow casting object, the viewpoint, and
            the direction of view (in front of or behind the viewer, above or below the viewer, left or right of the
            viewer)</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The <b>object geometry</b>, the shape and location (in relation to the viewer and light source) of
            the material form that is casting the shadow (a vertical pole, a horizontal bridge, a slanted roof, or a
            curving dome).</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The <b>surface geometry</b> on which the shadow is cast (a vertical wall, the horizontal ground, a
            slanted ramp, a curved surface such as a column or dome, or an irregular surface such as sand dunes or a
            rutted road).</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#formula6">visual angle</a>
            of the light source as seen from the shadow casting edge; measured in radians, this is its <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#projratio">projection ratio</a>, which determines
            the darkness and sharpness of the shadow edge (visually small or distant light sources produce sharper
            shadows).</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The <b>shadow distance</b> between the shadow casting edge and the shadow receiving surface (a
            smaller shadow distance produces sharper shadows).</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;The <b>difference in luminance and color</b> between the light source creating the shadow and the
            light source (if any) shining into the shadow; a large luminosity contrast <i>darkens the shadow and
              decreases the tinting</i> caused by illumination into the shadow.</p>

          <p>In most landscape situations the last three factors have a fixed effect: the angular size of the sun is
            relatively small (about 0.5°) and constant, most shadow casting objects are close to the ground, and the sun
            is an extremely bright light source. (The exceptions occur under cloud layers, which weaken and diffuse the
            solar light.) This reduces the construction of perspective shadows to the geometry of light source, viewer,
            object and surface, which have been traditionally illustrated using the straight corners and curved arches
            of architectural forms.</p>

          <p>Once solar shadows are mastered, the geometry of shadows from artificial or "local" light sources, as from
            streetlights or indoor ceiling fixtures, can be analyzed using the same basic rules of shadow perspective.
            These are listed below.<a name="shadowrules">&nbsp;</a><a name="rule1">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <hr width="370" color="#000000" align="center">
          <p align="center"><span class="rubric">The Basic Rules of Shadow Perspective</span></p>
          <hr width="370" color="#000000" align="center">

          <p><b>1. Light appears to emanate as straight line "rays" from the surface area of a light source</b>. Light
            appears to follow a straight line path from its origin at the light source. (This corresponds to perspective
            <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#fact1">fact&nbsp;1</a>.) The origin is
            physical — it has a measurable surface area — and light radiates from all parts of the surface.<a
              name="rule2">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><b>2. Light appears to radiate from the physical center of the surface or volume of the light source</b>.
            When constructing perspective edges, light always appears to emanate from the point at the center of the
            volume of the light source (if it radiates in all directions) or from the center of its surface image (if it
            is a directed light or reflecting surface).</p>

          <p>As a corollary, <b>all shadow edges can be constructed as light rays from a point light sources</b>. That
            is, the shape and edges of a shadow can be constructed on the image plane as if all light emanated from a
            single point on the image plane.</p>

          <p>This principle does not adequately describe actual shadows, because these typically have a diffuse or fuzzy
            border of partial shadow, called the <b>penumbra</b>. The penumbra appears to straddle or balance on the
            shadow edge, reducing the darkest area of complete shadow while adding a boundary of partial shadow, as <a
              class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#projratio">explained below</a>.</p>

          <p>However, a traditional rule of thumb is: <b>solar shadows are indistinguishable from the shadows created by
              a point light source</b>; the penumbra of solar shadows can be ignored in a perspective image. This rule
            actually applies only when the shadows are viewed from a distance — the object and its shadow are within a
            60° circle of view.</p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ shadows, reflections &amp; atmosphere 6_files/moon.jpg" width="380"
              height="252"></p>
          <p class="CC">angular size of the moon (and sun)</p>
          <p class="subCC">as shown in this 60° circle of view, the full moon has such a small visual size (compared to
            a floor lamp) that it is equivalent to the vanishing point for parallel light rays</p>

          <p>The sun's distance from earth is about 108 times its diameter, which means its <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#circleformulas">visual size</a> is about 0.5°. The
            moon coincidentally is almost exactly the same visual size, so the image size of the sun can be represented
            by the full moon surrounded by familiar, local objects, for example as it appears through a window. Then it
            does indeed resemble a point source (photo, above).</p>

          <p>Because the sun is so far away, compared to the height of objects on the earth's surface, light from the
            sun displays the same <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule7">visual
              convergence</a> as parallel light rays, and its disc is visually small enough to approximate the vanishing
            point for parallel visual rays (perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule6">rule&nbsp;6</a>). So the traditional
            perspective rule for solar shadows is actually: <b>the sun is a point light source of parallel light
              "rays"</b>.<a name="rule3">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><b>3. Parallel light rays define two vanishing points on opposite sides of the viewer's visual sphere</b>.
            Only one of the two points can appear on the image plane, when it is the <i>light vanishing point</i>
            (<b>lvp</b>). Light appears to <i>emanate</i> from one vanishing point (the light point) and to
            <i>converge</i> at the other vanishing point (the antilight point). The only exception is when the light
            rays are parallel to the image plane.</p>

          <p>This applies to any visually small light source, but specifically refers to the location of the sun in the
            sky (called the <b>solar point</b>) and the point exactly opposite from the sun on the viewer's visual
            sphere (called the <b>antisolar point</b>; diagram, below).</p>

          <p>The antisolar point is always located in the <b>shadow of the viewpoint on the image plane</b>, if it is
            visible. In other words, if you can see your shadow on the ground, then the <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#rainbows">shadow of your head</a> is centered on the
            antisolar point. (The same principle applies to the antilight point of artificial light sources.)<a
              name="rule4">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ shadows, reflections &amp; atmosphere 6_files/lvp.gif" width="380"
              height="380"></p>
          <p class="CC">location of the solar and antisolar points in "about face" orientations of the 90° circle of
            view</p>
          <p class="subCC">either point acts as the <i>light vanishing point</i> (<b>lvp</b>) in a perspective drawing
          </p>

          <p>4. The light vanishing point is located on the image plane by two angles: its <i>altitude</i> and the
            <i>azimuth</i>. The altitude is the visual angle (in degrees) of the light above or below the horizon line;
            the azimuth is the visual angle of the light to the left or right of the median line (principal point).</p>

          <p>The altitude of the solar/antisolar point <i>above or below</i> the horizon line is the the angle of its
            altitude, as rotated from the horizon line at the left or right <b>dvp</b>. This altitude, when projected
            onto the median line, defines a horizontal line on the image plane. The distance of the solar/antisolar
            point to the <i>left or right</i> of the median line is the the angle of its azimuth, as <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect3.html#rotatingvp">rotated from the median line</a> at the
            top or bottom <b>dvp</b>. This azimuth, when projected onto the horizon line, defines a vertical line on the
            image plane. The image of the sun or the antisolar point is located at the intersection of the two lines
            (diagram, above).</p>

          <p>If the viewer makes a 180° turn ("about face"), then the antisolar point (violet) is in the same location
            as would be the reflection of the sun in a body of water: at the same altitude rotated <i>below</i> the
            horizon line, and at the same azimuth on the same side (left or right) of the median line.<a
              name="rule5">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><b>5. Shadow edges form at the surface of light obstructing objects tangent to the direction of light
              rays</b>. Shadows typically have edges even if objects don't (because the objects are round or
            cylindrical, for example). This is because the surfaces have turned parallel to the direction of the light
            rays, creating a <i>shadow edge.</i></p>

          <p>This edge is actually two edges. One edge completely encircles the shadow casting object along the surface
            boundary between lighted and shadowed surface: this edge is called the <b>shadow terminator</b>. The
            terminator forms on all surfaces of the object tangent (parallel) to the direction of the light.</p>

          <p>The other edge encloses the shadowed area on the shadow receiving surface, as a projection of the
            terminator or a silhouette of the object as seen from the light source: this is the <b>shadow edge</b>.</p>

          <p>The right angled corner edge of a cubic or rectangular solid defines a terminator that remains at the
            corner of the object even as the light source moves in space, so long as one face on either side of the edge
            is illuminated and the other is in shadow. This is unlike the shadow casting edge on a cylindrical or
            irregularly shaped object, which moves around the surface of the object, and may reveal changing contours,
            as the location of the light source changes.<a name="rule6">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><b>6. A shadow edge is visible where it intersects a translucent medium or opaque <i>surface plane</i></b>.
            Shadows normally are not visible in air or water, and if they are they appear as shafts of darkness. A
            recognizable object shadow only appears when the light shining around an object strikes a surface behind it.
            As a simplification, this surface is defined as a plane, even though many natural and artificial surfaces
            are irregular or complex (hillsides are eroded, building walls contain windows, sidewalks are sloped, etc.).
          </p>

          <p>The surface plane has its own vanishing line, the <i>surface plane vanishing line</i> (<b>spvl</b>). In
            most perspective problems, the surface plane is either the ground plane, whose vanishing line is the horizon
            line, or the wall of a nearby building, whose vanishing line is perpendicular to the horizon line. Inclined
            planes also occur, as hillsides, sloping roofs or the average rise of stairways. So <b>surface planes may be
              horizontal, vertical or inclined</b>.<a name="rule7">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><b>7. The <i>light plane</i> is defined by the light vanishing point and the terminator edge of the shadow
              casting object</b>. For a straight edge terminator, such as the terminator along the corner of a
            rectangular solid such as a building, this plane represents a sheet of parallel light rays that define a
            straight line shadow edge on any flat (plane) shadow receiving surface (diagram, below).</p>

          <p>On the image plane, the length and orientation of a straight shadow edge are defined by its two <i>end
              points</i> (<b>ep</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>ep</b><sub>2</sub>) (perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule3">rule&nbsp;3</a>). The line segment between
            these end points, if extended, defines the <i>edge vanishing line</i>, which terminates at the <i>edge
              vanishing point</i> (<b>evp</b>).</p>

          <p>This plane has a unique <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule11">vanishing line</a>, the <i>light plane
              vanishing line</i> (<b>lpvl</b>). Obviously, because the edge is contained in the light plane, the edge
            vanishing point (<b>evp</b>) is contained in the light plane vanishing line (<b>lpvl</b>) (perspective <a
              class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule14">rule&nbsp;14</a>).</p>

          <p>This produces an important corollary: <b>the light vanishing point and edge vanishing point define the
              light plane vanishing line</b> (perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule14">rule&nbsp;14</a>). Once <b>lvp</b> and
            <b>evp</b> have been established on the image plane, the light plane vanishing line is simply the line that
            contains them both.<a name="rule8"></a></p>

              surface plane</b>. The two vanishing points are (1) the <i>shadow vanishing point</i> <b>svp</b> and (2)
            the <i>light vanishing point</i> <b>lvp</b>. Both points lie in the <i>light plane vanishing line</i>
            (<b>lpvl</b>).</p>

          <p>The <b>svp</b> for a straight line shadow requires at least (1) one edge station point (<b>sp</b>) to
            define the location and direction of a <i>shadow vanishing line</i> in the shadow receiving plane, and (2)
            the <b>lvp</b> requires two edge end points (<b>ep<sub>1</sub></b> and <b>ep<sub>2</sub></b>) to define two
            <i>shadow termination lines</i> that intersect the shadow vanishing line at the two shadow end points
            (<b>sep<sub>1</sub></b> and <b>sep<sub>2</sub></b>).</p>

          <p><span class="rubric">Outline of Shadow Constructions</span>. All perspective shadow problems require you to
            solve four basic construction tasks: (1) define the vanishing point geometry of the shadow edge, (2) define
            the vanishing line of the light plane, (3) define the vanishing line of the surface plane and the location
            of the shadow vanishing point(s), and (4) construct the shadow edge in the intersection of the light plane
            and surface plane.</p>

          <p>These four groups of construction steps vary in complexity depending on whether the shadow edge and shadow
            plane are parallel or oblique to the image plane and <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#typetable">parallel, oblique or perpendicular</a> to
            each other. This generic diagram (below) summarizes the perspective shadow elements and the abbreviations I
            use to identify them.</p>

          <p>(1) Perspective of Shadow Edge. Very often we already know the vanishing point for the shadow edge because
            we've used it to draw the shadow casting form. If not, we identify the shadow edge <i>end points</i>
            (<b>ep</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>ep</b><sub>2</sub>) and their <i>station points</i> (<b>sp</b><sub>1</sub> and
            <b>sp</b><sub>2</sub>) located vertically underneath them on the surface plane or ground plane. These can be
            used to find the <i>edge vanishing line</i> (<b>evl</b>) and the <i>edge vanishing point</i> (<b>evp</b>),
            except in cases where the edge is parallel to the image plane (and its vanishing point is not in the image
            plane, perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule4">rule&nbsp;4</a>).</p>

          <p><b>(2) Perspective of Light Plane</b>. The <i>light vanishing point</i> (<b>lvp</b>), which is either the
            solar point or antisolar point, is found by <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#rule4">rotating the angle</a> of the altitude and
            azimuth location of the point. The <b>lvp</b> will be either above the horizon (solar point) or below it
            (antisolar point). Then a line from <b>lvp</b> through <b>evp</b> defines the <i>light plane vanishing
              line</i> for that edge (<b>lpvl</b> <i>edge</i>); a line from <b>lvp</b> perpendicular to the horizon line
            defines a similar plane for vertical edges (<b>lpvl</b> <i>vertical</i>).</p>

          <p><b>(3) Perspective of Surface Plane</b>. The surface plane is usually the ground plane, in which case the
            <i>surface plane vanishing line</i> (<b>spvl</b>) is the horizon line. Otherwise the surface plane is part
            of a constructed object, and its vanishing line can be found from the edges of the form or their vanishing
            points (perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule10">rule&nbsp;10</a>). Finally, the intersection
            of <b>lpvl</b> <i>vertical</i> and <b>spvl</b> defines the <i>shadow vanishing point</i> for vertical edges
            (<b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i>), and the intersection of <b>lpvl</b> <i>edge</i> and <b>spvl</b> defines the
            <i>shadow vanishing point</i> for the shadow casting edge (<b>svp</b> <i>edge</i>).</p>

          <p><b>(4) Construct Shadow Edge</b>. A line from the shadow vanishing point <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i> through
            an edge station point <b>sp</b> defines a <i>shadow vanishing line.</i> A line from the light vanishing
            point <b>lvp</b> through the matching edge end point <b>ep</b> defines a <i>shadow termination line.</i>
            These lines intersect at the end point of the shadow edge (<b>sep</b>) on the shadow receiving surface.</p>

          <h3>shadows from solar light</h3>

          <p>This section describes how to construct the perspective solution for all combinations of vertical,
            horizontal or oblique edges casting shadows onto horizontal, vertical or inclined planes in 2PP or <a

              name="solarlight">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p>The defining attributes of solar light are: (1) the sun has an overwhelming illuminant power, which means
            there is only one shadow geometry among the objects in view; (2) the sun has a insignificant angular size
            (about 1/2° of visual angle) and a relatively small <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#projratio">penumbra</a> that grows smaller as the
            shadow casting object is closer to the shadow receiving surface, which means the sun is effectively a <a
              class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#rule2">point source</a> that generates
            parallel rather than divergent rays of light. Solar shadow edges can usually be described by a single line,
            as changes in the sharpness of the shadow edge are negligible over the distances defined by most
            architectural forms.</p>

          <p>The principal alternative light source, architectural or artificial lighting, is discussed in a <a

          <p>A common shortcut for rendering shadows, especially in architectural drawings, is the <b>mixed method</b>.
            This arbitrarily locates the solar light source so that light falls at a 45° angle to all horizontal and
            vertical edges. This permits all shadows to be constructed using the diagonal vanishing points

          <p><i>(1) Perspective of Shadow Edge.</i> The shadow casting edge is vertical (parallel to the picture plane),
            so there is only one station point (<b>sp</b>), and no edge vanishing point <b>evp</b> (there is no
            vanishing point for lines parallel to the image plane). If the vertical edge ends in the ground plane, the
            second end point (<b>ep<sub>2</sub></b>) is equal to the station point.</p>

          <p><i>(2) Perspective of Light Plane.</i> First, locate the <b>lvp</b> (solar or antisolar point) above or
            below the horizon line, to the left or right of the median line. The shadow casting edge is vertical,
            therefore the light plane is vertical for all locations of <b>lvp</b> (solar or antisolar point). Draw the
            light plane vanishing line <b>lpvl</b> <i>vertical</i> as a vertical line through the <b>lvp</b> to the
            horizon line. If the sun is near zenith (outside the 90° circle of view), then draw <b>lpvl</b>
            <i>vertical</i> as a vertical line that intersects the horizon line at the <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#rule4">azimuthal angle</a> of the <b>lvp</b> left or
            right of the median line.</p>

          <p><i>(3) Perspective of Surface Plane.</i> The surface plane is horizontal, so the surface plane vanishing
            line <b>spvl</b> is the same as the horizon line (parallel planes converge to the same vanishing line,
            perspective <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule13">rule&nbsp;13</a>).
            Finally, mark <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i> at the intersection of <b>lpvl</b> <i>vertical</i> and the horizon
            line (<b>spvl</b>).</p>

          <p><i>(4) Construct Shadow Edge.</i> Locate the vertical edge station point (<b>sp</b>), and draw a line from
            <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i> through <b>sp</b> <i>vertical</i> to define the shadow vanishing line <b>svl</b>.
            Then draw two lines from <b>lvp</b> through <b>ep</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>ep</b><sub>2</sub> to intersect
            <b>svl</b> at the shadow end point(s) (<b>sep</b>). The length of <b>svl</b> between the two points
            <b>sep</b> is the image of the shadow edge.</p>

          <p><b>Comments</b>. For vertical edges that meet the ground plane, such as wall edges or telephone poles,
            <b>sp = ep</b><sub>2</sub> and only one line to <b>lvp</b> is necessary to define the length (top end) of
            the edge shadow.<a name="type2">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><i>Shadow type 2 is the simplest problem that requires two shadow vanishing points. One of the shadow
              vanishing points is the vanishing point for the horizontal edges of the primary form: <b>vp</b>

              plane. This creates two different light plane vanishing lines, <b>lpvl</b> <i>horizontal</i> and
              <b>lpvl</b> <i>vertical</i> for the horizontal and vertical edges. Separate <b>lpvl</b>s and two
              <b>svp</b>s are used in more complex shadow problems, so the principles for identifying and constructing

          <p><i>(1) Perspective of Shadow Edge.</i> The shadow casting edge is horizontal (parallel to the ground
            plane), so the edge vanishing point <b>evp</b> lies in the horizon line (perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule14">rule&nbsp;14</a>). The horizontal shadow
            casting edge was drawn using a specific vanishing point <b>vp</b> <i>horizontal,</i> which is therefore the
            vanishing point for the horizontal edges: <b>vp</b> <i>horizontal</i> = <b>evp</b> <i>horizontal.</i></p>

          <p><i>(2) Perspective of Light Plane.</i> Insert the <b>lvp</b> (solar/antisolar point) above or below the
            horizon line by rotating the sun's altitude to the horizon and azimuth to the direction of view. Construct
            the <b>lvp</b> <i>vertical</i> as a vertical line through <b>lvp</b> to the horizon line. (The light plane
            vanishing line for the horizontal edge (<b>lpvl</b> <i>horizontal</i>) is not needed, but shown for
            clarity.)</p>

          <p><i>(3) Perspective of Surface Plane.</i> The surface plane is horizontal, so the surface plane vanishing
            line <b>spvl</b> is the horizon line (parallel planes converge to the same vanishing line, perspective <a
              class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule13">rule&nbsp;13</a>). Finally, (A)
            relabel the <b>vp</b> <i>horizontal</i> as <b>svp</b> <i>horizontal,</i> or extend a horizontal edge of the
            shadow casting object as a line through the horizon line, to locate <b>svp</b> <i>horizontal;</i> and (B)
            locate <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i> at the intersection of the vertical light plane (<b>lpvl</b>
            <i>vertical</i>) with the horizon line (<b>spvl</b>).</p>

          <p><i>(4) Construct Shadow Edge.</i> Each shadow end point (<b>sep</b>) is located at the intersection of a
            horizontal and vertical shadow vanishing line. Each end point <b>ep</b> has a matching station point
            <b>sp</b> in the ground plane, which is found with a vertical line from <b>ep</b> to the base of the wall or
            vertical support containing the horizontal edge. Then for each station point <b>sp</b>, draw a shadow
            vanishing line (<b>svl</b> <i>vertical</i>) from <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i> through the <b>sp</b>. Then for
            the matching end point <b>ep</b>, draw a line from <b>lvp</b> through <b>ep</b> to the <b>svl</b>
            <i>vertical</i> in the surface plane; their intersection defines the location of the shadow end point
            (<b>sep</b>). Finally, draw the horizontal shadow edges by connecting the ends of the edge shadows with a
            line to <b>svp</b> <i>horizontal.</i></p>

          <p><b>Comments.</b> The diagram shows two separate light plane vanishing lines (<b>lpvl</b> <i>vertical</i>
            and <b>lpvl</b> <i>horizontal</i>) to demonstrate that a <b>lpvl</b> always contains the light vanishing
            point <b>lvp</b> and the edge casting the shadow, and that in every case the shadow vanishing point
            <b>svp</b> is located at the <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#rule8">intersection of two planes</a> — the surface
            plane vanishing line (in this case, the horizon line) and the light plane vanishing line for a specific edge
            (horizontal or vertical).</p>

          <p>The example above distinguishes the two end points <b>ep</b> and their corresponding station points
            <b>sp</b> and shadow end points <b>sep</b>, to make explicit that the two shadow end points <b>sep</b> can
            be constructed using the methods for <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type1">shadow type 1</a>. The ground plane lines
            from <b>svl</b> <i>vertical</i> through the <b>sp</b>s are used to define the vertical edges of shadows, and
            lines from <b>lvp</b> through the <b>ep</b>'s are used to define the vertical location of shadow ends
            (corners). The <b>svl</b>s <i>horizontal</i> are found by connecting <b>sep</b>s projected vertically from
            the same horizontal edge. Using this method, the <b>svp</b> <i>horizontal</i> is not needed in the
            construction.</p>

          <p>Alternately, if the <b>svp</b> <i>horizontal</i> and the station points <b>sp</b> are already known from
            the perspective construction of the wall or support containing the horizontal shadow edge, then only one
            shadow point (e.g., <b>sep<sub>1</sub></b>) need be constructed using the <b>lvp</b>; the shadow outline can
            be constructed with shadow vanishing lines from this point to the two <b>svp</b>s and/or from the
            <b>svp</b>s through the <b>sp</b>s. This is more convenient when <b>lvp</b> is nearly overhead and far
            outside the circle of view.<a name="type3">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><i>(1) Perspective of Shadow Edge.</i> The inclined edge vanishing point <b>evp</b> lies in the vanishing
            line for the vertical plane of the wall or support under the inclined edge (perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule14">rule&nbsp;14</a>). The <b>vp</b>
            <i>horizontal</i> is found by extending a line through the station points to the horizon line; the edge
            vanishing line is a line drawn vertically through this point. Then lines extended through the edge end
            points intersect this line at their vanishing points. The diagram shows two inclined edges in the same
            vertical plane: <b>ep<sub>1</sub></b> and <b>ep<sub>2</sub></b> extend to intersect the wall plane vanishing
            line at edge vanishing point <b>evp<sub>1</sub></b>; <b>ep<sub>2</sub></b> and <b>ep<sub>3</sub></b> extend
            to intersect the vanishing line at the edge vanishing point <b>evp<sub>2</sub></b>.</p>

          <p><i>(2) Perspective of Light Plane.</i> Insert the <b>lvp</b> (solar/antisolar point) above or below the
            horizon line by rotating the sun's altitude to the horizon and azimuth to the direction of view. Construct
            the <b>lvpl</b> <i>vertical</i> as a vertical line through <b>lvp</b> through the horizon line (for shadows
            from the vertical edges of the supporting wall).</p>

          <p>The diagram shows two inclined edges, therefore there are two corresponding light planes:
            <b>lvpl<sub>1</sub></b> <i>inclined</i> from <b>lvp</b> through <b>evp<sub>1</sub></b>, and
            <b>lvpl<sub>2</sub></b> <i>inclined</i> from <b>lvp</b> through <b>evp<sub>2</sub></b>.</p>

          <p><i>(3) Perspective of Surface Plane.</i> The surface plane is horizontal; the <b>spvl</b> is the horizon
            line. The vertical shadow vanishing point (<b>svp</b> vertical) is at the intersection of the horizon line
            with a vertical line through <b>lvp</b>.</p>

          <p>There are two inclined shadow vanishing points <b>svp</b> <i>inclined</i> for the two inclined edges. Both
            of these are at the intersection of the respective <b>lpvl</b> with the surface plane vanishing line
            <b>spvl</b> (the horizon line). Only <b>svp<sub>2</sub></b> <i>inclined</i> is visible in the diagram;
            <b>svp<sub>1</sub></b> <i>inclined</i> is outside the image very far to the right.</p>

          <p><i>(4) Construct Shadow Edge.</i> The elevation of the first end point (<b>ep<sub>1</sub></b>) is found as
            a vertical shadow (<a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type1">shadow type
              1</a>) from <b>sp<sub>1</sub></b>, which defines the shadow end point <b>a</b>. The opposite shadow end
            point <b>c</b> is found as the vertical shadow for <b>ep<sub>3</sub></b>. Finally, a line is drawn from
            <b>a</b> to <b>svp<sub>1</sub></b> <i>inclined,</i> and from <b>svp<sub>2</sub></b> <i>inclined</i> through
            <b>a</b>: these intersect at <b>b</b>, the shadow end point for the peak of the end wall.</p>

          <p><b>Comments</b>. I've contrived this example to show how inclined edges can often produce edge vanishing
            points or shadow vanishing points that are very far out of the image area. However, it will be obvious that
            the inclined edge shadow can be constructed just as accurately by an indirect method — as the vertical
            shadows from the three edge end points (<b>a</b>, <b>b</b> and <b>c</b>), including the center station point
            <b>sp<sub>2</sub></b>. Then the three points are connected with straight lines to define the inclined edge
            shadows.</p>

          <p>This "indirect" method (using vertical shadows only) is preferable when there are few inclined edges, the
            <b>lvp</b> is within or not far outside the circle of view, or the inclined edge shadow is nearly parallel
            to the horizon line. The "direct" method (using the <b>svp</b>s <i>inclined</i>) is better if the <b>lvp</b>
            is far outside the circle of view, or there are multiple inclined edges at the same angle receding in
            perspective (for example, a row of houses on level ground with identical roof pitches); in this case a
            single <b>evp</b> can be used to construct the edges for them all.<a name="type4">&nbsp;</a></p>

            the horizontal elements of one building cast shadows on the vertical surfaces of a neighbor building. It
            arises from any vertical element near a wall, for example a telephone pole located next to a building or the

          <p class="CC">(4) vertical edge shadow on vertical surface</p>

          <p><i>(1) Perspective of Shadow Edge.</i> The shadow casting edge is vertical (parallel to the picture plane),
            so there is only one station point (<b>sp</b>), always at least one end point (<b>ep<sub>1</sub></b>) and no
            edge vanishing point <b>evp</b> (there is no vanishing point for lines parallel to the image plane). If the
            vertical edge ends in the ground plane, the second end point (<b>ep<sub>2</sub></b>) is equal to the station
            point. Next, mark the end station points <b>sp</b> <i>vertical</i> for all vertical edge end points
            <b>ep</b> casting shadows. The edge vanishing point <b>evp</b> <i>horizontal</i> is the horizontal vanishing
            point established for the perspective construction, or is found by extending a line through the appropriate
            <b>sp</b>s to the horizon line.</p>

          <p><i>(2) Perspective of Light Plane.</i> Insert the <b>lvp</b> (solar/antisolar point) above or below the
            horizon line by rotating the sun's altitude to the horizon and azimuth to the direction of view. Construct
            the <b>lvpl</b> <i>vertical</i> (for shadows from the vertical edges of the supporting wall) as a vertical
            line through <b>lvp</b> through the horizon line. The <b>lpvl</b> <i>horizontal</i> is a line from
            <b>lvp</b> through <b>evp</b> <i>horizontal.</i></p>

          <p><i>(3) Perspective of Surface Plane.</i> For shadows on horizontal surfaces, the <b>spvl</b>
            <i>horizontal</i> is the horizon line. For shadows on vertical surfaces, the <b>svpl</b> <i>vertical</i> is
            a vertical line through <b>evp</b> <i>horizontal.</i> Then <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i> is at the intersection
            of <b>lpvl</b> <i>vertical</i> and <b>spvl</b> <i>horizontal</i> (the horizon line); <b>svp</b>
            <i>horizontal</i> is located at the intersection of <b>lpvl</b> <i>horizontal</i> and <b>svpl</b>
            <i>vertical</i>: it is <b>evp</b> <i>horizontal.</i></p>

          <p><i>(4) Construct Shadow Edge.</i> In the most common situation, a shadow extends across the ground to the
            base of a wall, then extends up the wall to its end point. Construct the shadow in the same way. First draw
            the shadow vanishing line (<b>svl</b>) from <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i> through the <b>sp</b> <i>vertical</i>
            of the shadow casting edge. Extend the shadow from <b>sp</b> along the shadow vanishing line (<b>svl</b>)
            until it reaches the base of the vertical surface (<b>sp</b> [wall]). Draw a vertical line from <b>sp</b>
            [wall] up the side of the vertical surface. Cut this line with a shadow termination line from the vertical
            end point <b>ep</b> to <b>lvp</b> to locate the vertical end point of the shadow <b>sep</b>. Finish any
            horizontal shadow elements using the procedures for <a class="text"

          <p><b>Comments</b>. The color of the shadow projected onto the vertical surface will be different than the
            shadow projected onto the ground: it is typically a darker shade of the vertical surface color, and is in
            most situations lighter valued than the shadow on the ground because it is illuminated by light reflected
            from the ground or pavement. The ground shadow, in turn, can be colored by reflected light from the
            illuminated areas of vertical shadow receiving surfaces.<a name="type5">&nbsp;</a></p>

            the horizontal elements of one building cast shadows on the vertical surfaces of a neighbor building. The
            shadow casting edge may be oriented (1) parallel to, (2) oblique to, or (3) perpendicular to the shadow

          <p><i>The key to this shadow type is that the orientation of the shadow receiving surface to the shadow

            segment (<b>ep</b><sub>1</sub> to <b>ep</b><sub>2</sub>) to the horizon line to locate the horizontal
            vanishing point (<b>evp</b> <i>horizontal</i>), or use the existing <b>vp</b> <i>horizontal</i> for the wall
            or support containing the horizontal edge. Find the horizontal edge end station points
            (<b>sp</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>sp</b><sub>2</sub>) by vertical lines from the edge end points, and draw the
            <b>horizontal edge station line</b> through these points to <b>evp</b> <i>horizontal.</i> Finally, locate

          <p><i>(3) Perspective of Surface Plane.</i> The horizontal shadow receiving surface is the ground plane or
            surfaces parallel to it; <b>spvl</b> <i>horizontal</i> is the horizon line. The vertical shadow receiving
            surface is a constructed wall or building at any arbitrary angle to the image plane; the <b>spvl</b>s for
            these surfaces are not required for the construction. The shadow vanishing points <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i>

          <p><i>(4) Construct Shadow Edge(s).</i> For <i>each vertical edge</i> of the shadow receiving vertical

            through the wall station point for a wall edge to the horizontal edge station line, to define a
            corresponding horizontal edge station point. (2) Construct a vertical line from this point to find the
            corresponding edge end point. (3) Construct a shadow termination line from this end point to <b>lvp</b>. (4)
            Identify the intersection of this line with the wall edge. Thus, a shadow vanishing line from <b>svp</b>
            <i>vertical</i> through <b>a</b> defines <b>sp<sub>a</sub></b> in the horizontal edge station line; a
            vertical line from <b>sp<sub>a</sub></b> defines <b>ep<sub>a</sub></b> in the horizontal edge; and a shadow
            termination line from <b>ep<sub>a</sub></b> to <b>lvp</b> defines <b>a'</b> at the surface edge; and so on
            to define <b>b'</b>, <b>c'</b> and <b>d'</b> in the diagram. Finally, connect all the wall edge points
            (<b>a'</b> to <b>d'</b> in the example) to define the shadow edge across the vertical surface(s).</p>

          <p><b>Comments</b>. The method for constructing horizontal shadows on vertical surfaces is just a repetition
            of the method to define vertical shadows on vertical surfaces (<a class="text"

            relevant edge station points defined in the horizontal edge station line. It is typically more tedious than
            complicated. There are three simplifying situations when only one shadow edge end point must be located:</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;for vertical surfaces parallel to the horizontal shadow casting edge: these shadows recede along a
            shadow vanishing line from a single shadow edge point (<b>a'</b> or <b>b'</b> in the diagram) to <b>svp</b>
            <i>horizontal</i> across the parallel vertical surface.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;for vertical surfaces perpendicular to the horizontal shadow casting edge: these shadows recede
            toward <b>lvp</b> and are defined by a shadow termination line from <b>lvp</b> through a single wall edge
            point (<b>c'</b> or <b>d'</b> in the diagram) across the perpendicular vertical surface.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;for vertical surfaces oblique to the horizontal shadow casting edge: these shadows recede along a
            vanishing line found as follows. (1) Extend the base line (station line) of the oblique edge, to create a
            new <b>evl</b>, until it intersects the horizontal edge station line (<b>X</b> in the diagram). (2)
            Construct a vertical from this point to the horizontal shadow casting edge to define the edge point
            (<b>Y</b>). (3) Draw a vanishing line from <b>Y</b> through the oblique edge shadow point (<b>b'</b> or

          <p>The diagram shows the inclined edge as a ramp to approximate a stairway or the end portion of an inclined
            roof.</p>

          <p><i>(1) Perspective of Shadow Edge.</i> First identify the vanishing point <b>vp</b> <i>horizontal</i> and
            surface plane vanishing line <b>spvl</b> <i>vertical</i> for the shadow receiving vertical surface. Next,
            extend the station line under the inclined edge (from <b>sp<sub>1</sub></b> through <b>sp<sub>2</sub></b>)
            to the horizon line to locate the inclined edge vanishing point (<b>vp<sub>1</sub></b>), then construct a
            vertical line through this point: this is the inclined edge plane vanishing line (<b>epvl</b>
            <i>inclined</i>). Finally, extend a line from <b>ep<sub>1</sub></b> through <b>ep<sub>2</sub></b> to
            intersect <b>epvl</b>: this is the vanishing point for the inclined edge (<b>evp</b>).</p>

          <p><i>(2) Perspective of Light Plane.</i> Insert the <b>lvp</b> (solar/antisolar point) above or below the
            horizon line by rotating the sun's altitude to the horizon and azimuth to the direction of view. Construct
            the <b>lvpl</b> <i>vertical</i> (for shadows from the vertical edges of the supporting wall) as a vertical
            line through <b>lvp</b> through the horizon line. Finally, <b>lpvl</b> <i>inclined</i> is found as a line
            through <b>lvp</b> and <b>evp</b>.</p>

          <p><i>(3) Perspective of Surface Plane.</i> For vertical shadows on horizontal surfaces, the <b>spvl</b>
            <i>horizontal</i> is the horizon line, and the <b>svp</b> <i>horizontal</i> is the intersection of
            <b>spvl</b> <i>horizontal</i> with <b>lpvl</b> <i>vertical.</i></p>

          <p>For horizontal shadows on vertical surfaces, the <b>svpl</b> <i>vertical</i> is a vertical line through
            <b>vp</b> <i>horizontal,</i> and <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i> is the intersection of <b>spvl</b>
            <i>vertical</i> with <b>lpvl</b> <i>horizontal</i> (not shown in diagram), which is <b>vp</b>
            <i>horizontal.</i></p>

          <p>Finally, <b>isvp<sub>V</sub></b>, the vanishing point for shadows of the inclined edge on vertical
            surfaces, is at the intersection of <b>spvl</b> <i>vertical</i> and <b>lpvl</b> <i>inclined;</i> and
            <b>isvp<sub>H</sub></b>, the vanishing point for shadows of the inclined edge on horizontal surfaces, is at
            the intersection of <b>spvl</b> <i>horizontal</i> (the horizon line) and <b>lpvl</b> <i>inclined.</i></p>

          <p><i>(4) Construct Shadow Edge.</i> The shadow edges for the inclined edge must recede either to
            <b>isvp<sub>V</sub></b> or <b>isvp<sub>H</sub></b>, depending on the surface they are cast on. The diagram
            shows a typical sequence: the shadow vanishing line <b>svl</b> on the horizontal ground plane extends from
            the inclined edge station point (<b>ep<sub>1</sub></b>) to <b>isvp<sub>H</sub></b> until it intersects the
            station line of a vertical wall (<b>a</b>); from that point it recedes toward <b>isvp<sub>V</sub></b> until
            it reaches the edge of the wall (<b>b</b>). From there it is back in the horizontal plane, and therefore in
            the <b>svl</b> to <b>isvp<sub>H</sub></b> until it meets the shadow termination line from <b>lvp</b> to
            <b>ep<sub>2</sub></b> at <b>d</b>. The shadow edge of the wall is in the <b>svl</b> from the wall station
            point <b>c</b> to the <b>svp</b> [verrtical].</p>

          <p><b>Comments</b>. Inclined edge shadows, like the horizontal edge shadows in <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type5">shadow type 5</a>, depend on the angle
            between the shadow edge and the vertical surface. However, as with shadow type 5, the shadow construction
            can be simplified to the projection of the shadow edge points at the edges where the vertical surface
            changes its orientation to the inclined edge; the shadow edge is traced by connecting these points.</p>

          <p>It's worthwhile to study the figure until you can visualize what happens to the shadow vanishing points and
            the appearance of the inclined shadow when the relative positions of the light point, inclined shadow
            casting edge and the vertical shadow receiving surface are changed. Use a pencil, a book stood upright on
            its covers and a desk lamp to try out the variations. Three general principles emerge:</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;Shifting the location of the light point in relation to a fixed inclined edge plane and fixed
            vertical plane only changes the location of the shadow edge on the vertical plane: the angle of the shadow
            edge is always equal to the angle of the inclined edge to the ground plane.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;Rotating the vertical wall plane, in relation to a fixed inclined edge plane and light source,
            changes the angle of the shadow edge to the ground plane: but the angle can only vary between the angle of
            the inclined edge to the ground plane and the angle of the altitude of the light source.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;Rotating the inclined edge plane, in relation to a fixed vertical plane and light source, can change
            the angle of the shadow edge to the ground plane across the entire range from vertical to horizontal,
            depending on the altitude of the light source. If the inclined edge plane is nearly parallel to the
            direction of light, with the higher end point closer to the vertical plane, the shadow edge will always be
            nearly vertical; if the lower end point is closer to the wall, the shadow edge may become horizontal or even
            incline in the opposite direction, depending on the altitude of the light source and the slope of the
            inclined edge. <a name="type7">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><i>This shadow type requires you to construct the vanishing line for the inclined plane (<b>ipvl</b>) in

          <p class="CC">(7) vertical edge shadow on inclined surface</p>

          <p><i>(1) Perspective of Shadow Edge.</i> The shadow casting edge is vertical (parallel to the picture plane),
            so there is only one station point (<b>sp</b>), always at least one end point (<b>ep<sub>1</sub></b>) and no
            edge vanishing point <b>evp</b> (there is no vanishing point for lines parallel to the image plane). If the
            vertical edge ends in the ground plane, the second end point (<b>ep<sub>2</sub></b>) is equal to the station
            point. In the diagram, three vertical edges are shown: the foreground pole, and the verticals on both sides
            of the inclined plane.</p>

          <p><i>(2) Perspective of Light Plane.</i> Insert the <b>lvp</b> (solar/antisolar point) above or below the
            horizon line by rotating the sun's altitude to the horizon and azimuth to the direction of view. Construct
            the <b>lvpl</b> <i>vertical</i> (the light plane defined by shadows from vertical edges) as a vertical line
            through <b>lvp</b> and the horizon line. Because the shadow casting edge is vertical, an <b>lpvl</b>
            <i>inclined</i> is not required.</p>

          <p><i>(3) Perspective of Surface Plane.</i> The shadow receiving surface is inclined, therefore it is
            necessary to construct the inclined plane vanishing line <b>ipvl</b> in order to locate the shadow vanishing
            point. Two vanishing points are needed to identify this line:</p>

          <p>(a) Two parallel edges or lines in the inclined plane can be extended, and their intersection defines one
            edge vanishing point, <b>evp</b><sub>1</sub>. Alternately, one inclined edge (e.g., <b>ad</b>) can be
            extended as a line; its station points is extended as a second line that meets the horizon line (at
            <b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>), and a vertical line from this vanishing point intersects the edge vanishing line at
            <b>evp</b><sub>1</sub>.</p>

          <p>(b) A horizontal line segment, in this case the base of the ramp or stairway, is extended until it
            intersects the horizon line; this intersection defines the horizontal edge vanishing point,
            <b>evp</b><sub>2</sub>.</p>

          <p>The <b>ipvl</b> is then a line drawn between these two <b>evp</b>'s. The <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i> is
            located at the intersection of the <b>lpvl</b> <i>vertical</i> and the horizon line. The inclined plane
            shadow vanishing point for vertical edges (<b>isvp</b> <i>vertical</i>) is found at the intersection of the
            light plane vanishing line for vertical edges (<b>lpvl</b> <i>vertical</i>) and the inclined plane vanishing
            line (<b>ipvl</b>).</p>

          <p><i>(4) Construct Shadow Edge.</i> As in previous examples, the construction strategy is to begin at the
            edge station point, and follow a shadow vanishing line for the shadow receiving surface, until this line
            intersects a shadow termination line from <b>lvp</b> to <b>ep</b>. For the vertical pole in the diagram, the
            shadow termination line, <b>ep</b> to <b>lvp</b>, is drawn first. The shadow edge for the vertical pole is
            drawn from the vertical edge station point (<b>sp</b>) toward <b>svp</b> <i>vertical,</i> until it meets the
            edge of the inclined surface (at <b>x</b>); then the line is continued <b>isvp</b> <i>vertical</i> until it
            meets the edge with a horizontal or vertical surface (<b>y</b>); then it is continued as a vertical line
            until it meets the shadow termination line (at <b>z</b>).</p>

          <p>For the shadow of the vertical corner on the inclined plane, the shadow termination line (<b>b</b> to
            <b>lvp</b>) is drawn first. Then the shadow for the vertical edge <b>ab</b> is constructed as a line from
            the edge station point (<b>a</b>) to <b>isvp</b> <i>vertical;</i> this intersects the shadow termination
            line at <b>c</b>, the shadow of the corner point <b>b</b>. The horizontal shadow is constructed as a line
            from the corner shadow point <b>c</b> to the horizontal edge end point <b>d</b>. If this is not appropriate
            to the problem at hand, then the <b>isvp</b> <i>horizontal</i> must be found to complete the line; see <a

          <p><i>(1) Perspective of Shadow Edge.</i> Because the shadow casting edge is horizontal, the horizontal edge
            vanishing point is contained in the horizon line (<b>evp</b> <i>horizontal</i> = <b>vp<sub>1</sub></b>
            <i>horizontal;</i> see <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type2">shadow
              type 2</a>). This is already given in the perspective construction.</p>

          <p><i>(2) Perspective of Light Plane.</i> Insert the <b>lvp</b> (solar/antisolar point) above or below the
            horizon line by rotating the sun's altitude to the horizon and azimuth to the direction of view. Construct
            the <b>lpvl</b> <i>vertical</i> (for shadows from the vertical edges of the supporting wall) as a vertical
            line through <b>lvp</b> through the horizon line. Construct the <b>lpvl</b> <i>horizontal</i> as a line from
            <b>lvp</b> to <b>evp</b> <i>horizontal</i> (<b>vp<sub>1</sub></b> <i>horizontal</i>). The inclined edge
            shadows are onto the horizontal plane, so <b>lpvl</b> <i>inclined</i> is not required.</p>

          <p><i>(3) Perspective of Surface Plane.</i> The surface receiving the shadow is inclined, therefore it is
            necessary to construct the <b>ipvl</b> from the vanishing point for two lines in the inclined plane. One of
            these is typically its intersection with a horizontal plane, which extends to <b>vp<sub>2</sub></b>
            <i>horizontal;</i> the other is found by extending a side edge, then extending the station points for this
            edge to the horizon line (<b>vp<sub>3</sub></b>) and constructing a vertical line from this point to
            identify the inclined <b>evp</b>. Then a line through <b>evp</b> and <b>vp<sub>2</sub></b> identifies
            <b>ipvl</b>.</p>

          <p>The vanishing point for horizontal shadows on the inclined plane (<b>isvp</b> <i>horizontal</i>) is found
            at the intersection between the horizontal light plane vanishing line (<b>lpvl</b> <i>horizontal</i>) and
            the inclined plane vanishing line (<b>ipvl</b>). The vanishing point for vertical shadows across the
            inclined plane (<b>isvp</b> <i>vertical,</i> necessary for the vertical supports for the horizontal edge, or
            for the pole in the diagram) is found at the intersection between the vertical light plane vanishing line
            (<b>lpvl</b> <i>vertical</i>) and the inclined plane vanishing line (<b>ipvl</b>). The vanishing point for
            horizontal shadows on a horizontal plane (<b>svp</b> <i>horizontal</i>) is the horizontal vanishing point
            (<b>vp<sub>1</sub></b> or <b>vp<sub>2</sub></b>) in the horizon line.</p>

          <p><i>(4) Construct Shadow Edge.</i> The shadow edge is constructed by starting at one horizontal edge shadow
            end point and working toward the other, using the appropriate shadow vanishing point. In the diagram, the
            corner point <b>a</b> is found as in <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type1">shadow type&nbsp;1</a>, and extended in the
            horizontal plane toward <b>svp</b> <i>horizontal</i> until it intersects the inclined plane (<b>b</b>); from
            there the shadow edge is continued toward <b>isvp</b> <i>horizontal</i> until it reaches the edge of the
            plane (at <b>c</b>). In the diagram, the end of the horizontal edge is out of view, on the back vertical
            side of the inclined structure.</p>

          <p>The shadow of the vertical pole on the inclined plane is defined by two hidden points: a shadow vanishing
            line from <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i> through the hidden pole station point to the hidden station point in
            the vertical plane containing the inclined edge (<b>x</b>), and from there by a hidden vertical line to the
            inclined edge point <b>y</b>. Then the shadow edge extends along the shadow vanishing line from <b>isvp</b>
            <i>vertical</i> through <b>y</b> to the shadow termination line from <b>lvp</b> through the pole <b>ep</b>;

          <p class="CC">(9) inclined edge shadow on inclined surface</p>

          <p>As a study aid, the diagram shows the inclined plane vanishing lines and light plane vanishing lines for
            both planes (labeled <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>). However, in the example only the vanishing line for the edge
            casting the shadow from plane 1 (<b>lpvl</b> [inclined 1]) and the vanishing line for the plane receiving
            the shadow on plane 2 (<b>ipvl<sub>2</sub></b>) are necessary to construct the shadow.</p>

          <p><i>(1) Perspective of Shadow Edge.</i> The edge casting the shadow is in the inclined plane <b>1</b>. The
            station points for the vertical sides of this plane recede to the horizon line at <b>vp<sub>1</sub></b>, and
            the inclined edges intersect a vertical line from <b>vp<sub>1</sub></b> at <b>evp<sub>1</sub></b>. The
            second edge vanishing point (<b>evp<sub>2</sub></b>) is located on the horizon line at
            <b>vp<sub>2.1</sub></b>. (To finish shadows cast by the second inclined plane on horizontal surfaces,
            <b>vp<sub>2.2</sub></b> is included.)</p>

          <p><i>(2) Perspective of Light Plane.</i> Insert the <b>lvp</b> (solar/antisolar point) above or below the
            horizon line by rotating the sun's altitude to the horizon and azimuth to the direction of view. Construct
            <b>lvpl</b> <i>inclined 1</i> (for shadows cast by the inclined edges in plane <b>1</b>) as a line through
            <b>evp<sub>1</sub></b> and <b>lvp</b>. (Compare with <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type8">shadow type 8</a>.)</p>

          <p><i>(3) Perspective of Surface Plane.</i> Construct the vanishing line for the second inclined plane,
            <b>ipvl<sub>2</sub></b>, using the methods described under <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type7">shadow type 7</a>. Locate the shadow
            vanishing point for inclined shadows on the inclined surface, <b>isvp</b><sub>12</sub>, at the intersection
            of <b>ipvl<sub>2</sub></b> and <b>lpvl</b> <i>inclined 1.</i></p>

          <p><i>(4) Construct Shadow Edge.</i> Construct the shadow in sequence, starting from the inclined edge station
            point <b>a</b>, and from each plane edge intersection (<b>b</b> and <b>c</b>) toward the appropriate shadow
            vanishing point.</p>

          <p>Study the diagram, and note the construction of the three light plane vanishing lines <b>lpvl</b>; note
            also the relative locations of the shadow vanishing point for the inclined edge of plane 1 on horizontal
            surfaces, <b>isvp<sub>1</sub></b>, which is found at the intersection of the light plane vanishing line for
            inclined plane <b>1</b>, <b>lpvl</b> <i>inclined 1,</i> and the <b>spvl</b> <i>horizontal</i> (the horizon
            line); and the location of the vanishing point for the inclined edge of plane <b>2</b> on horizontal
            surfaces, <b>isvp<sub>2</sub></b>, which is found at the intersection of the light plane vanishing line for
            the second plane, <b>lpvl</b> <i>inclined 2,</i> and the horizon line.</p>

          <p><span class="rubric">Irregular Shadow Edges</span>. In all these perspective examples the shadow casting
            edge is a straight line and the shadow receiving surface is a plane. What happens in situations where the
            edge or the surface or both are curving or irregular?</p>

          <p>There are no universally valid rules to follow here, but there is usually a simple procedure you can use to
            make the perspective construction. The best procedure is always defined by two things: (1) the rectilinear
            shadow type (from the nine shadow types above) that the irregular shadow most resembles, and (2) a method
            for projecting the irregular edge into perspective space using a rectilinear framework, for example as was
            done to <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect5.html#projectcircle">project a
              circle</a> onto a plane.</p>

          <p class="CC">shadow of a curving edge in a vertical plane on a horizontal surface</p>

          <p>The example above shows a common architectural problem: an arch or vaulted opening casting a shadow on the
            floor or ground.</p>

          <p>In this case, the basic problem most resembles shadows from edges in vertical planes cast onto a horizontal
            surface, which is either <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type1">shadow
              type 1</a> or <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type2">shadow type
              2</a>.</p>

          <p>After looking at the problem in the diagram (above), the best way to project the curve of <i>this</i> arch
            seems to be: trace the curve of the arch with separate, approximately equally spaced edge points (<b>ep</b>,
            green dots), and use vertical lines to project these edge points onto the ground plane as station points
            (<b>sp</b>) in the edge station line for the arch. Then use <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type1">shadow type&nbsp;1</a> to project the
            <b>ep</b>s onto the ground plane as separate shadow end points (<b>x</b>), using separate shadow vanishing
            lines and shadow termination lines for each point. Finally, connect the points in the ground plane to
            construct the shadow edge.</p>

          <p>Most curving edges will be contained in regular forms that are drawn first, using standard two point
            perspective methods, which means the vanishing points and measure points for the perspective image are
            already known. In that case, it would also be possible to project a grid of squares over the surface of the
            arch opening, using the measure point and vanishing point to determine the correct amount of foreshortening
            and recession. Then shadow type 1 would be used to project this grid onto the ground. Finally, the grid
            could be used to reconstruct the shadow projection, again as was done in the demonstration of <a
              class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect5.html#projectcircle">projecting a circle</a>
            onto a plane. This method is more convenient and more accurate when the shadow edge is intricate or very
            irregular.</p>

          <p>If the shadow receiving surface is irregular, for example convex like the exterior surface of a dome, then
            you must make a slice through the surface along the shadow vanishing line for the vertical or horizontal
            edge falling across the surface, then project onto this line the profile (elevation) of the curving surface,
            using the shadow vanishing line as the baseline or station line for the profile. Then all shadow
            construction lines drawn from the edge points to <b>lvp</b> terminate along this profile edge, rather than
            along the shadow vanishing line (the line from the <b>sp</b> to <b>svp</b>) at its base.</p>

          <p>For complex edges cast on complex surfaces, the simplest solution is to abstract both the edge and surface
            into a more basic geometric problem, solve the basic shadow forms in this context, then draw freehand an
            approximation of the shadow deviations from this simplified edge.<a name="locallights">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <h3>shadows from local lights</h3>

          <p>The perspective geometry of shadows from local lights — all artificial light sources, including fires,
            lamps, street lights and illumination through windows or reflected from architectural structures — differs
            from solar shadows in three specific ways:</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;the shadow vanishing point is replaced by the <b>normal point</b>(s) for each shadow receiving
            surface</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;light sources are usually visually large and close to the shadow casting edge, which requires us to
            calculate the projection ratio for the shadow <b>penumbra</b>, and</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;there is usually <b>more than one light source</b>, and the relative difference in luminance between
            the primary and secondary light sources is always much smaller than the difference between sunlight and
            skylight in landscape settings.</p>

          <p><span class="rubric">The Normal Point</span>. The diagram below shows the case of an elevated local light
            such as a street lamp. Now the vertical shadow vanishing point <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i> is not a vanishing
            point on the horizon line but a specific point within the local perspective space — the <i>normal point</i>.
          </p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ shadows, reflections &amp; atmosphere 6_files/locshad1.gif"
              width="380" height="254"></p>
          <p class="CC">the geometry of the normal point</p>

          <p>The normal point is the point on a plane that is <b>physically closest to the light source</b>: that is, a
            line from the normal point <i>perpendicular to the surface plane</i> will intersect the physical center of
            the light source. For horizontal planes, the perpendicular line will be vertical, so the normal point is
            directly underneath the light source (diagram, above). Thus, the <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i> in landscape
            settings is actually on a great circle, from the viewpoint to the location on the earth where the sun
            appears directly overhead.</p>

          <p>The essentials of shadow construction remain the same, however. The <i>shadow vanishing line</i> is still
            the intersection of <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#rule8">two
              planes</a>, the light plane and the surface plane, which is always drawn from the normal point through an
            edge station point; and the length of the shadow is still determined by a <i>shadow termination line</i>
            from the center of the local light source to the end of the edge, as described for <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type1">shadow type&nbsp;1</a>.</p>

          <p>The major complication is that <b>each interior wall, floor, ceiling and furniture surface creates a
              separate normal point</b> for all shadows cast onto it by each light source in the room. The diagram
            (below) shows the simplest arrangement: a single ceiling fixture within an empty room, but if we add several
            light sources and pieces of furniture, the problem can become quite complex.</p>

              width="380" height="328"></p>
          <p class="CC">normal points for an indoor light source</p>

          <p>For each architectural surface, the normal point acts as the shadow vanishing point for <i>shadows</i> cast
            upon it. The diagram (below) shows the case of two separate shadow casting posts fixed into the floor and a
            wall, and the shadow vanishing line (from the normal point through the perpendicular point or "station
            point" <b>sp</b> ) and the shadow termination line (from the light source through the edge end point
            <b>ep</b>) in each case.</p>

          <p class="CC">indoor cast shadows on a single surface</p>

          <p>The diagram (below) shows the case of horizontal edges that are either parallel, perpendicular or oblique
            to the wall and/or floor. In this case the oblique horizontal shadows can be constructed using methods
            similar to those for <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type5">shadow
              type&nbsp;5</a> or <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type3">shadow
              type&nbsp;3</a>, or the points can be plotted out at each surface edge (floor, ceiling or wall corners)
            using principles for horizontal or vertical shadows cast on horizontal or vertical surfaces (<a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type1">shadow type&nbsp;1</a>, <a class="text"

          <p class="CC">indoor cast shadows on multiple surfaces</p>

          <p>In the diagram, the horizontal bar <b>ab</b> is oblique to both walls behind it. Drawing its shadow, shadow
            vanishing lines are extended from the floor normal point through the edge end station points
            (<b>sp<sub>1</sub></b> and <b>sp<sub>2</sub></b>) to the surface edge (baseboard). From there vertical lines
            are constructed to meet the shadow termination line from the light source through the end points <b>a</b>
            and <b>b</b>: these intersect at the shadow end points <b>a'</b> and <b>b'</b>.</p>

          <p>Rather than construct the inclined shadow vanishing point necessary to define the oblique horizontal
            shadows, the simpler approach is to locate the shadow transition at the corner between the two walls. To do
            this, a line is extended from the normal point to the corner point (<b>x</b>); this intersects the
            horizontal edge station line at <b>y</b>; a vertical from this point locates the horizontal edge point
            (<b>c</b>) that casts its shadow into this corner. A vertical from <b>x</b> intersects the shadow
            termination line (from the light source through <b>c</b>) at <b>c'</b>; the shadow is completed by drawing
            the two edge segments <b>a'</b> to <b>c'</b> and <b>c'</b> to <b>b'</b>. Note that, because the shadow
            distance increases, the shadow and penumbra at the corner point <b>c'</b> are slightly larger than they are
            at <b>a'</b> or <b>b'</b>.<a name="projratio">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><span class="rubric">The Penumbra</span>. With very few exceptions, light sources are not point sources —
            they have a perceptible visual size — and therefore the shadows cast by local lights (and by the sun or
            moon) have a characteristic <b>penumbra</b> or diffuse edge, caused when light from opposite sides of the
            light source creates overlapping shadow edges.</p>

          <p>These overlapping edges produce a continuous gray scale, from the shadowed to sunlit value of the shadow
            surface, that depends on the visual angle of the source as seen from the shadow edge (diagram, below).</p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ shadows, reflections &amp; atmosphere 6_files/source.gif" width="380"
              height="104"></p>
          <p class="CC">projection ratio and penumbra width</p>

          <p>The visual size of the light source is essentially the <i>source diameter divided by the source
              distance</i> from the shadow casting edge. The exact method for calculating the source visual size is <a
              class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#formula6">given here</a>, but it is
            more convenient to express this angle in radians, as the <b>projection ratio</b> of the source at the shadow
            casting edge:</p>
          <p class="CC">projection ratio = visual angle * (&#960;/180)</p>

          <p>The projection ratio becomes larger as the light source diameter is greater or as the source distance is
            less. But once the projection ratio is determined, then the <b>penumbra width</b> is the projection ratio
            times the distance between the shadow casting edge and the shadow receiving surface, or the <b>shadow
              distance</b>:</p>

          <p class="CC">penumbra width = projection ratio * shadow distance</p>

          <p>The penumbra always <b>straddles the shadow boundary</b> that would be produced by a point light source at
            the physical center of the actual light source (dotted line, diagram above). Half of the penumbra width is
            inside this point source shadow boundary, reducing the area of complete shadow; half is outside this
            boundary as an area of partial shadow.</p>

          <p>The calculation for penumbra width applies to a shadow receiving surface perpendicular to the direction of
            light; if the surface is at an oblique angle to the light, then the projection ratio must be divided by the
            cosine of the amount of deviation from a perpendicular angle (cosine(0°)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.0). Otherwise, the
            projection ratio is constant for all edges under solar illumination, which means the penumbra width is
            dictated by the shadow distance. As the shadow distance increases, the penumbra increases proportionately
            (image, below).</p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ shadows, reflections &amp; atmosphere 6_files/casting.jpg" width="380"

          <p class="CC">the penumbra is proportional to the shadow distance</p>
          <p class="subCC">in a cable railing system, the higher cables cast a farther shadow, producing a larger
            penumbra</p>

          <p>The term "projection ratio" emphasizes that the penumbra is actually a kind of image — a gradient image of
            the visual diameter of the light source. As with any image, the size of the image depends on how far it is
            projected. In the demonstration below, a pinhole image of the sun is projected either a short or long
            distance, and as the shadow distance increases, both the diameter of the sun's image and the penumbra width
            increase equally.</p>

        <td valign="top" align="left">This image quality of the penumbra causes it to mimic the shape of the light
          source; this is easiest to see in the shadows cast by an oblong window or a single fluorescent light fixture
          (diagram, right). Because the sun forms a round pinhole image, its penumbra has a constant width regardless of
          the orientation of the shadow edge; however the tonal gradient of its penumbras forms an ogive or "S" curve,
          steepest in the middle, which gives solar shadows a relatively distinct inner boundary between dark and light,
          especially when the penumbra is small (image, above). <a name="penumbradist">&nbsp;</a>
          <p></p>

          <p>The importance of the penumbra to a perspective image depends on several factors — the <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#formula6">visual angle</a> of the light source, the
            distance the shadow is cast, and the distance of the viewer from the shadow edge — and these change with the
            specific situation. There is no hard and fast rule as to when a penumbra significantly alters the appearance
            of a shadow edge.</p>

          <p>However, as <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#rule2">explained
              above</a>, the projection ratio for solar shadows is nearly constant at 0.5°, or a projection ratio of
            about 0.009, so the width of all solar penumbras is roughly 1% of the shadow distance. For very large shadow
            distances, for example in the shadows cast by cliffs or multistory buildings, this projection is
            substantial. The observation deck of the Eiffel Tower is about 1000 meters above the ground, so the penumbra
            of its noon solar shadow is more than 10 meters wide. But when viewed from an airplane at an altitude of
            3000 meters, the shadow appears clearly defined.</p>

          <p class="subCC">solar shadow of a sculpture viewed from 1/2, 1 and 2 times the object height</p>

          <p>Most objects illuminated by sunlight are closer to the ground than we are to their shadows, and solar
            penumbras form a relatively sharp border on their interior edge, so the 1% penumbra is visually
            insignificant when the <i>viewing distance to the shadow is at least twice the shadow distance</i> (photos,
            above). This rule applies to all <b>objects located on the ground and contained within a 60° circle of
              view</b> or less; the same distance rules that eliminate <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#bestview">perspective distortions</a> also disguise
            the penumbra in solar shadows. At most viewing distances, the sun can be treated as a <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#rule2">point source</a>.</p>

          <p>The rule for local lights is more complex, but in general the <b>penumbra is significant for artificial
              lights</b>. This is because local lights (1) are physically large, (2) are fitted with shades, reflectors
            or covers that enlarge the visual size of the light source or diffuse the light it emits, and (3) are
            contained in rooms or passageways that constrain the viewing distance to the shadow. These factors usually
            offset the small source distances of local lights. The distinctly fuzzy edges that result are more restful
            to the eyes, but also give interior light shadows a distinctive appearance (diagram, below).</p>

          <p class="CC">differences between solar and local light shadows</p>

          <p>If diffusing shades are removed, local lights can have moderate to small projection ratios. For example, a
            standard frosted incandescent light bulb, 5&nbsp;cm wide, has a projection ratio of 5% at 1 meter and 1% at
            5 meters. But local lights are not normally viewed in a "naked" mode.</p>

          <p>Much indoor lighting is created by partially cropping exterior daylight (blue sky or reflected sunlight),
            or by artificial light sources that are close enough to present a significant angular size. In either case
            the light source will cast a <b>diffuse shadow</b> with a very large penumbra. Most diffuse shadows are
            subtly complex, and it is impractical to recreate them using perspective construction. However, a knowledge
            of perspective geometry can be used to define the outer limits and dark core of a shadow, and can guide your
            observation of the shadow so that you can reproduce it freehand more accurately.</p>

          <p class="CC">the geometry of indirect light</p>

          <p>The example shows a daylight window opening. The labels identify a single light point <b>A</b> in the
            window and two points, <b>a</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>a</b><sub>2</sub>, at the top of the two shadow casting
            sides of a cylinder. These points cast two shadow points, <b>s</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>s</b><sub>2</sub>, on
            the horizontal surface. Their locations are found using the same technique as for vertical solar shadows on
            a horizontal surface (<a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect6.html#type1">shadow
              type 1</a>). Point <b>A</b> is the light vanishing point, and point <b>C</b>, on the horizontal plane
            directly below <b>A</b>, is the vertical shadow vanishing point (<b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i>). Two lines from
            the base of the cylinder through these points define the edges of the cylinder shadow cast from all points
            between <b>A</b> to <b>B</b> in the window.</p>

          <p>The diagram also shows three additional mappings from three other points in the window (<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>
            and <b>F</b>), which produce three similar, overlapping shadows behind the cylinder from different locations
            of the shadow terminator on the cylinder surface.</p>

          <p>If it were feasible to map all points across the window in this way, the result would be a large penumbra
            area of diffuse or overlapping shadows. This composite shadow is lightest at the edges and at the extreme
            end (farthest from the cylinder), which receives some direct light from some parts of the window (the
            <b>penumbra</b>), and darkest at the center just behind the base of the cylinder (the <b>umbra</b>), which
            receives no direct light from any part of the window. All diffuse shadows have a penumbra, but they only
            have an umbra if the shadow casting object is close enough to the shadow receiving surface to completely
            block all light from all parts of the light source. The umbra is typically uniform in darkness and, for
            rectangular sources such as a window, the shadow lightens continuously between the edge of the umbra and the
            edge of the penumbra.</p>

          <p>All diffuse cast shadows can be solved in a similar way, first by plotting the extreme outside edges of the
            shadow from the extreme top, side and bottom points of the large light source, which will show the
            boundaries of the penumbra and umbra, then gradating the difference between the umbral and penumbral values
            from the edge of the umbra out to the edge of the penumbra.</p>

          <p><span class="rubric">Luminance Contrast</span>. The amount of brightness or lightness contrast between the
            diffuse shadow and the illuminated part of the horizontal surface depends on the total amount of light
            coming from the diffuse light source (the window), the proportion of light coming from other sources in the
            room, including reflected light from the walls and ceilings, and the light adaptation of the eye.</p>

          <p>The appearance of artificial light shadows cannot easily be presented as specific principles, but a few
            rules of thumb are helpful:</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;Interior shadows are not nearly as dark as solar shadows, but in general shadows become darker when
            there is only a single source of illumination and the illuminance from that source is very low (for example,
            candlelight). As rooms become brighter, the light intensity pushes the eye into a larger luminance response
            range, and interior surfaces reflect more light back into the room.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;Interior shadows are more distinctly colored by light reflected from other surfaces, and especially
            by skylight entering the room from a nearby window</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;By design, interior light fixtures diffuse light to soften shadows, as this is more restful and
            pleasing to the eye; as a result, interior shadows are generally very diffuse, and the actual extent of the
            shadowed area may be much smaller or of a different shape than the perspective construction indicates it
            should be. In other words, the more complex the shadow, the more important observation becomes in rendering
            it accurately.<a name="reflections">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <h3>perspective of reflections</h3>

          <p>Reflections are the linear perspective of an image transformed by the shape of a surface. If the surface is
            flat, like the surface of still water, then the image is reversed — top to bottom, for water reflections,
            and left to right for vertical mirrors. If the surface is curved or perturbed, then the reflection is both
            reversed and distorted.<a name="planereflections">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><span class="rubric">Reflections in Mirrors or Windows</span>. The rules for plane (flat surface)
            reflections are simple: <b>everything is governed by lines perpendicular to the mirror surface</b>. That is,
            identical points in the object and its reflection lie on a single line perpendicular to the mirror surface,
            and the reflected object appears at the same distance behind the mirror as the actual object is in front of
            the mirror.</p>

          <p>The optics of this situation are shown at right, for an observer at a <i>viewpoint</i> looking obliquely
            into a reflecting mirror lying in the plane <b>ax</b>. (We look edgewise at this plane, to see front and
            back in the same way.) The visual rays are reflected at the mirror surface, and in this reflection the size
            of the visual <b>angle 1</b> before reflection and <b>angle 2</b> after reflection are on opposite sides of
            a line perpendicular to the mirror surface and are exactly the same size, so the object appears as if in a
            straight line path through the mirror and into the virtual space on the opposite side. This produces a view
            of the object as if it were seen from the <b>virtual viewpoint</b>, not the actual viewpoint, and with the
            object reversed (left to right) in a direction that is also perpendicular to the mirror surface.</p>

          <p>This geometry also holds for objects that are <i>not</i> reflected in the mirror, for example the viewer.
            The <i>virtual viewpoint</i> is as far behind the mirror plane as the actual viewpoint is in front of it,
            and both are on a line perpendicular to the mirror plane around the point&nbsp;<b>x</b>.</p>

          <p>The geometry for vertical mirrors usually must be worked out as part of a perspective drawing. In the
            simplest problem, the mirror is hanging on a vertical wall, or the reflection is in a window or glass wall.
          </p>

          <p class="CC">the geometry of vertical (mirror or window) reflections</p>

          <p>This wall has its own vanishing point for the floor and ceiling edges (<b>vp</b><sub>2</sub>), which
            creates a second vanishing point for lines perpendicular to the mirror (wall) surface
            (<b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>). If one or both vanishing points are not already defined, they can be found using
            the methods for <a class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect3.html#2pprojection">circle
              of view reconstruction</a>. It is also necessary to find the <b>mirror station line</b>, which is usually
            the base along the floor of the wall supporting the mirror or window, or the ground line of the exterior
            foundation supporting the reflecting window or door.</p>

          <p>To construct the reflection of an object in front of the mirror (such as one of the four colored spheres),
            first construct a line from the object's station point (for example, <b>a</b> under the red sphere) back to
            the perpendicular vanishing point <b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>. This line is perpendicular to the mirror plane and
            it defines an intersection with the wall station line (<b>b</b> for the red sphere).</p>

          <p>Now you must find the same distance <b>ab</b> <i>behind the mirror</i> along the perpendicular line
            <b>a-vp</b><sub>1</sub>. This is found by taking a line from the appropriate <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect3.html#measurepoints">measure point</a>
            (<b>mp</b><sub>2</sub>) — which is always a measure point defined by the <i>mirror plane</i> vanishing
            points and not any reflected object vanishing points — through point <b>b</b> until it intersects a line
            through <b>a</b> parallel to the image plane: this defines point <b>c</b>. The line segment <b>ca</b> is the
            distance <b>ba</b> without foreshortening. Recess this length to the perspective depth of point <b>b</b> by
            drawing a line from <b>c</b> to <b>vp</b><sub>1</sub> until it intersects a line through <b>b</b> parallel
            to the image plane at point <b>d</b>. Foreshorten this distance by a line from <b>d</b> to
            <b>mp</b><sub>2</sub>; the intersection <b>e</b> of this line with the line <b>a-vp</b><sub>1</sub> is the
            <b>virtual station point</b> of the reflected object. The rest of the image can be constructed from this
            point.</p>

          <p><span class="rubric">The Virtual Viewpoint and Station Point</span>. This method can be repeated for other
            objects reflected in the mirror or glass, or it can be done once only, to identify a reflected image and its
            station point, which then can be used to find the virtual viewpoint and virtual station point. These are
            useful because they define the location and size of every reflection in the mirror:</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;a line from the object station point to the virtual station point (of the viewer) intersects the
            mirror station line <b>directly under the object's virtual station point</b>. In the diagram, the line from
            <b>a</b> to the virtual station point intersects the mirror station line at <b>x</b>, which defines a
            vertical line to <b>e</b>, the reflected image of <b>a</b>. In the same way a line from <b>1</b> at the base
            of the pole to the virtual station point intersects the mirror station line at <b>2</b>.</p>

          <p>•&nbsp;lines from the top and bottom of the object to the virtual viewpoint define the vertical size of the
            reflected object. Thus, the two lines from the virtual viewpoint to <b>a</b> and <b>g</b> define the
            location of the points <b>e</b> and <b>f</b> in the reflection where the lines intersect the vertical line
            from <b>x</b>; a line from the base of the pole <b>1</b> to the virtual viewpoint defines the base of the
            pole <b>3</b> where the line intersects the vertical line from <b>2</b>.</p>

          <p>In the diagram above, the red sphere defines its station point <b>a</b> and its reflected virtual station
            point <b>e</b>. A vertical line from <b>e</b> to the mirror station line defines a new point <b>x</b>. Then
            a line from <b>a</b> through <b>x</b> will intersect a vertical line from <b>vp</b><sub>1</sub> at the
            virtual station point. Notice how point <b>y</b> determines the location of the pole reflection, and the
            height of the pole reflection is found by two lines from the ends of the pole to the virtual viewpoint.</p>

          <p>Note that <b>the virtual viewpoint is the vanishing point for mirror perpendiculars (pvp)</b>. This is
            obvious when you think about it: because all the mirror perpendiculars are all parallel, they all recede to
            a single vanishing point (perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule6">rule&nbsp;6</a>). A vanishing point is simply
            a visual ray viewed head on (perspective <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#rule1">rule&nbsp;1</a>), and the only mirror
            perpendicular you can view head on is the reflection of your own viewpoint (that is, the reflection of your
            eyes). All mirror perpendiculars always recede to that point, even when your reflection is not visible in
            the mirror.</p>

          <p>In addition, <b>all lines that intersect the viewer's station point are perpendicular to the horizon line
              in the image plane</b>. So in the diagram above, the station point is found on a vertical line from
            <b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>! This may go against your intuitions, but it is another perspective "distortion" that
            corresponds exactly to the visual facts.</p>

          <p>How far <i>below the horizon line</i> is the virtual station point? You can find it by constructing the
            reflection of a single object, as described above, or you can construct it more accurately from the
            intersection of the mirror station line with the vertical line from the virtual viewpoint (point <b>s</b> in
            the diagram at right). Simply draw a horizontal line from <b>s</b> to the median line to find <b>x</b>. This
            creates a triangle with <b>sx</b> as its far side, <b>s/viewpoint</b> as its hypotenuse and
            <b>x/viewpoint</b> as its base. (Remember, the vertical line from <b>pvp</b>, although it seems to be
            parallel to the median line, is actually at a converging angle to the median line, and both lines intersect
            at the viewpoint.)</p>

          <p>To find a triangle of exactly the same size and proportions in perspective, you draw one line from <b>s</b>
            to the principal point <b>pp</b>, and a second line from <b>x</b> to the perpendicular vanishing point
            (virtual viewpoint) <b>pvp</b>. These two lines intersect at <b>z</b>, which is at the same distance from
            the image plane as the virtual station point. So draw a second horizontal line through <b>z</b> to intersect
            the vertical from <b>pvp</b>: this intersection is the virtual station point, <b>vsp</b>.</p>

          <p>What if you look directly into the mirror, so that <b>pvp</b> (virtual viewpoint) = <b>pp</b>? In that
            case, the point <b>s</b> is located at the intersection of a vertical line from your left or right
            <b>dvp</b> down to the mirror station line, and the point <b>x</b> is at the intersection of the median line
            with the mirror station line. Connect <b>s</b> to <b>pp</b> and <b>x</b> to <b>dvp</b> to find <b>z</b>, and
            from there a horizontal line back to the median line locates <b>vsp</b>.</p>

          <p><span class="rubric">Reflected Vanishing Points</span>. I used spheres in the first example to avoid the
            distracting issue of reflected vanishing points. Now we can tackle these using the example of a reflected
            rectangular box. In the diagram below, the mirror (purple rectangle) lies in a vertical plane which
            intersects the horizon line at the <b>mirror vanishing point</b> (<b>mvp</b>, magenta). The angle of the

            the top of the circle of view; this angle is close to 45°. At 90° to the mirror vanishing point is the
            <b>perpendicular vanishing point</b> (<b>pvp</b>, magenta), the vanishing point for all perpendiculars to
            the mirror plane which, as we've seen, is also the virtual viewpoint.

            <b>v</b>. The location of <b>vp</b><sub>1</sub> is shifted to the right of the mirror plane by the angle
            <b>z</b> shown at the top, so the virtual position of (<b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>) must be shifted <i>to the
              left</i> of the mirror plane by the same amount. Usually <b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>vp</b><sub>2</sub> and
            <b>mvp</b> are already known by construction in your perspective drawing. So to construct the reflection,
            simply draw lines from these points to the point <b>v</b> at the top of the circle of view, measure the
            angle <b>z</b> with a protractor centered on <b>v</b>, and make the rotation by measuring angle <b>z</b> on

            at a right angle to the line from (<b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>).</p>

          <p>To position the reflection, draw a line from <b>vp</b><sub>1</sub> through a bottom corner of the box
            (<b>x</b><sub>1</sub>, magenta), and into the mirror station line (the line going back to <b>mvp</b>) to
            define point <b>R</b>. Then draw the reflection of this line from point <b>R</b> back to

            will intersect the first line at <b>x</b><sub>2</sub>, the virtual location of the bottom corner of the
            reflected box. Draw the second reflected vanishing line from <b>x</b><sub>2</sub> to
            (<b>vp</b><sub>2</sub>). Finally, draw a line from the opposite corner <b>y</b><sub>1</sub> (green) to

            now have the location and size of the front bottom width of the reflected box.</p>

          <p>Determine the height of the reflected box by a third line from a top corner of the actual box to
            <b>pvp</b>, and intersect this line with a vertical from <b>x</b><sub>2</sub>. Determine the depth of the

            the intersection with the reflected vanishing line to (<b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>). Complete the front and sides
            of the box with virtual vanishing lines from these points to (<b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>) and
            (<b>vp</b><sub>2</sub>) as appropriate, using the steps described for the <a class="text"

          <p>The vanishing points for edges that are parallel or perpendicular to the mirror plane reflect to their
            original locations, so they do not have to be rotated.</p>

          <p>Finally, if the mirror plane is at an angle to the direction of view <i>and</i> the mirror is tilted
            forwards or backwards from that plane (for example, a mirror leaning backward against a wall or hanging
            forward from a loose length of picture wire), then the perspective problems become more complex, because
            vertically oriented objects will appear reflected in three point perspective (3PP) and these three points
            must be determined separately for all objects in 2PP with unique vanishing points. These problems are too
            complex to delve here. Approximate them freehand, or trace a photograph of a similar setup.<a

          <p>Well, there are two nuances here and they both involve the vertical <i>height</i> of the reflection in the
            water.</p>

          <p>First, the height is always judged from the <i>reflection plane</i> and not the base of the object itself.
            In the diagram, the end point <b>ep</b> of the pole is not reflected around its station point <b>sp</b> but
            around its station point in the plane of the water surface, <b>sp</b><sub>W</sub>.</p>

          <p>For objects standing along the edge of a gently sloping beach or marsh this is not a distraction, because
            the ground level is roughly the same as the water level. However the diagram shows the pole standing on a
            raised embankment, and this distance has to be included in the total length that is included to find the
            reflected end point, <b>ep</b><sub>R</sub>.</p>

          <p>The second nuance is that the object and its reflection will have an identical height only if the direction
            of view is nearly parallel to the water surface. This is the case in those dramatic <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/artist05.html#painting5">postcard views</a> of huge mountains seen
            reflected in the surface of an enormous lake. In the example above, however, the reflection of the pole is
            clearly viewed at a downward angle, which will make it appear foreshortened in comparison to the actual
            pole.</p>

          <p>No problem: because the perpendiculars are parallel to the image plane, their measure points are the <a
              class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#framework">diagonal vanishing
              points</a> or distance points (<b>dvp</b>) at the top or bottom of the circle of view. Just use these
            diagonals to determine the correct height of the reflection, using the methods <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#unitdepth">described here</a> for projecting a
            measure bar or unit dimension into perspective space.</p>

          <p>That is, (1) draw a line from <b>sp</b><sub>W</sub> to any convenient point along the horizon line (the
            example uses <b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>, but any point will do), (2) project in depth the vertical distance to be
            reflected with a line from <b>ep</b> to a <b>dvp</b> to define point <b>R</b><sub>1</sub>, (3) draw a
            vertical line through <b>R</b><sub>1</sub>, (4) get the location of <b>R</b><sub>2</sub> by a diagonal from
            <b>sp</b><sub>W</sub> to the same <b>dvp</b> through the vertical line, and (5) locate <b>ep</b><sub>R</sub>
            by a line from your vanishing point (<b>vp</b><sub>1</sub>) through <b>R</b><sub>2</sub> to a vertical line
            under <b>sp</b><sub>W</sub>. Piece o' cake.<a name="water">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p><span class="rubric">Reflections in Rippling Water</span>. Water surfaces that are disturbed by waves or
            ripples create very complex reflection patterns. Here the issue is not reconstructing them with geometry,
            but understanding how to interpret the reflections visually so that you can approximate their poetry
            freehand.</p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ shadows, reflections &amp; atmosphere 6_files/reflect3.gif"

          <p class="CC">reflections from waves (side view)</p>

          <p>This diagram shows the surface of water across two wave fronts, viewed from the side. The parallel gray
            lines approaching from the right represent lines of sight to the viewer (which at most landscape distances
            are nearly parallel for the small angular size of most ripples or waves). The source of these lines in the
            landscape are shown as blue lines. The vertical bars at the right represent the appearance of the waves or
            ripples in vertical section, with the reflection from the crest of each wave (<b>c</b>) indicated by a black
            dot.</p>

          <p>The top example shows the appearance of the waves when the angle of view is close to parallel to the water
            surface — that is, the waves or ripples are viewed from a great distance and/or from a viewpoint along the
            shore of the water. In this situation the crest of each wave sharply crops the view of the wave behind it,
            so reflections skim the tops of the waves in tight visual spacing, shown at right as closely alternating
            bars of brown (far landscape) and blue (low sky). At this angle the inverted reflections of landscape
            features on the far side of the water are recognizable, or the water takes on an indistinct, darker color.
          </p>

          <p>The middle example shows the wave viewed from a slightly sharper downward angle. In this case more of the
            wave front reflection is visible, and it is upside down: the lower part of the wave reflects a higher
            location in the sky, indicated by a darker blue bar. This produces a sharp contrast between the crest of one
            wave and the forward surface of the wave behind it, and the reflections of far objects are lost in the
            appearance of alternating bands of light and dark.</p>

          <p>The bottom example shows ripples or waves from an angle where everything except the back side of each
            undulation is visible. Now two things happen. The numbered dots (<b>1</b> to <b>12</b>) show that the
            reflections first cycle up into the sky, then angle back towards the earth, so that each ripple reflection
            is an inverted image of earth, low sky and high sky (brown, white and blue bars at right) joined to an
            upright image of sky, low sky and earth. However, at the point where the reflections join, the angle of view
            into the wave front is close to perpendicular to the water surface, so the reflection is weakened and the
            line of sight may actually penetrate the water (points <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>), darkening the reflection and
            shifting its color towards blue green.</p>

          <p class="CC">reflections from waves (top view)</p>

          <p>This diagram shows the waves or ripples viewed from above, and in this view waves can take two forms. If
            the undulations are parallel wave fronts and are not perpendicular to the direction of view, which is the
            typical case in still water disturbed by a prevailing wind or passing water craft, then reflections appear
            as repeated, evenly space wiggles. If the waves are actually intersecting each other from many different
            angles, which is the typical case in open water, they create a pattern of roughly circular undulations of
            different sizes. When viewed from an acute angle, these produce complex reflection patterns of wiggles
            within wiggles, repeated at irregular intervals. If the reflection is from a point source, such as the moon
            or a streetlight, the reflections seem to break apart and form complex rings or orbits in the water.</p>

          <p>These irregular ripples, the darling of marina painters, are less common in landscape views. Instead,
            ripples of all types (but especially parallel waves or ripples created by a steady prevailing wind) produce
            an effect called <i>anisotropic reflections</i> or simply <b>vertical smearing</b>, which only affects the
            <i>reflected vertical location of horizontal features,</i> rather than reflected horizontal location of
            vertical features. So the sides of the sun or the vertical bridge pilings and arcade columns have the same
            horizontal (left to right) location in the reflection, making their edges relatively crisp, while the
            horizontal top and bottom of the sun or horizontal bridge span and arcade arches have smeared out vertical
            locations in the reflection (image at right).</p>

          <p>In most cases the sky is pretty much one color and the land silhouette a second color, which creates a
            simple two tone pattern to the reflections. The areas of sky are called <b>skypools</b> and the areas of
            land reflections <b>landpools</b> (image at right). The landpools dominate at far distances close to the
            opposite shore, and skypools dominate at near distances close to the observer. The transition between the
            two areas appears as a complex interweaving or overlapping of roughly circular areas of reflection, which
            represent the troughs of the irregular circular waves shown in the illustration above. These roughly
            circular troughs appear to be stretched out because we view them from the side, which causes extreme
            foreshortening.</p>

          <p>The optical effects of water reflections are a deep and fascinating study. I strongly recommend you consult
            the chapter "Water and light" in <b>Color and Light in Nature (Second Edition)</b> by David Lynch and
            William Livingston (Cambridge, 2001).<a name="reflectcurved">&nbsp;</a></p>

            from curved surfaces such as cylinders (pipes, steel columns), spheres, bubble windows and the like.</p>

          <p>I have made a diligent search of the literature, and the solutions I have found for creating images of
            convex or concave reflections consist either of proprietary computer animation software or incredibly
            tedious ray tracing procedures. The best solution for an artist today is either to trace or copy a
            photograph of the effect, or make a patient freehand drawing. In that case, a general expectation of the
            distortion can help guide your view.</p>

          <p>M.C. Escher's <i>Hand with reflecting sphere</i> (1935, right) beautifully demonstrates the general form of
            spherical reflections, and is in a tradition of anamorphic portrait studies going back to Parmigianino's
            <i>Self portrait in a convex mirror</i> (c.1524). This lithograph is precisely informative about the optical
            distortions imposed on the reflection of the surrounding room (his studio in Rome) and displays the
            curvature of perspective lines in the borders of the ceiling and walls and in the bookshelf along two walls.
            (The globe is positioned below the bookshelf against a wall, with the closest room corner on the right and
            the entire room and illuminating window behind the artist.) It also shows how the spherical reflection
            magnifies objects very close to it and diminishes objects farther away.</p>

          <p>This complex image would be far easier to draw freehand, or by tracing a photograph, than through laborious
            perspective construction. But as a construction stunt, the major landmarks of the room (the ceiling corners,
            the window frame, the bookshelves and the location of the chairs) could be mapped by hand into the sphere
            outline using the transversals of the <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect5.html#curvilinear">spherical projection</a> template. The
            rest of the drawing could be filled in from those reference points.</p>

          <p>These distorted reflections can be "reverse engineered" by <b>anamorphic images</b>, which are two
            dimensional, unrecognizable drawings that become recognizable if viewed from an extreme oblique angle or in
            the reflection from a cylindrical or spherical mirror. These were very common in the 17th and 18th
            centuries, both as perspective curiosities and as examples of the projective distortions of interest to
            mapmakers and geometers.</p>

          <p>Scanned into a computer, Escher's image (for example, the bookshelves and ceiling boundaries) could be
            "reverse engineered" by animation software into a precise map of the room reflected there, and I assume that
            some aspiring student of art history will do the exercise simply to find out whether the image consists of a
            traced photograph or contains the inevitable systematic distortions of a freehand drawing. (From what I know
            of Escher's esthetic, I'm betting on freehand.)<a name="aerial">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <h3>aerial perspective</h3>

          <p>Aerial perspective is not really perspective at all, but is the effect of the atmosphere on the appearance
            of distant landscape. Leonardo da Vinci originated the term when he wrote "There is a kind of perspective
            called aerial perspective which depends on the thickness of the air," and he contributed important
            observational studies of the phenomenon. Since then, aerial perspective has often been cited as a feature of
            distant views that linear perspective could not explain. But that belief is incorrect: aerial perspective
            <i>is</i> exactly governed by linear perspective geometry in the same way that a <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#textures">perspective gradient</a> is.</p>

          <p>Aerial perspective is partly caused by the <i>Raleigh scattering</i> of light by individual air molecules,
            but this effect is sometimes overwhelmed by the scattering due to particles of smoke or dust, and molecules
            of water, mixed in the atmosphere. The scattering due to smoke or dust is highly variable, and if extreme
            can affect the color of objects at a distance of a few dozen meters; the Raleigh scattering has more
            consistent perspective limits.</p>

          <p>As the diagram shows, the Raleigh scattering increases linearly with distance (roughly double the effect at
            twice the distance), and is usually first noticeable at a distance of about 750 meters or more. In the
            standard 90° circle of view the viewing distance (usually 1.5 meters) has a <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect2.html#halfdistance">fixed location</a> on the image plane,
            just half (50%) of the distance from the ground line to the horizon line. This locates an object on the
            ground plane that is 750 meters from the viewer at 99.9% of the distance from the ground line to the horizon
            line. So aerial perspective is a horizon feature, and does not apply to objects that appear visibly lower
            than the horizon line. Any atmospheric effect that occurs <i>below the horizon</i> can only be due to mist,
            fog or smoke.</p>

          <p class="CC">the geometry of aerial perspective</p>

          <p>The two effects traditionally attributed to aerial perspective are (1) a shift toward blue color as objects
            are farther away, and (2) a blurring of object edges. Both statements are inaccurate — especially the first,
            which was formulated in those faraway days when smokestack manufacturing, coal generation and millions of
            cars did not exist.</p>

          <p>The <b>atmospheric color shift depends on the atmospheric contents</b>: smoke, dust or smog shifts the
            color toward white, yellow, brown or gray, while water vapor in clean air shifts the color toward blue, an
            effect called <i>airlight</i> (illustration at right). This landscape contrast is especially evident between
            winter and summer months in desert areas such as Arizona or New Mexico.</p>

          <p>The veiling due to particles of smoke, dust or mist shows a significant increase in effect closer to the
            ground, because these particles tend to sink in the air. Thus, the top of a distant mountain will appear
            darker (less veiled) than its base, and this contrast increases with distance (right). The veiling due to
            water vapor and air molecules is much more evenly distributed from the ground upward, and there is little or
            no effect change across distance.</p>

          <p>The veiling effect also depends on the angle of solar illumination; water molecules and dust or smoke
            particles mostly scatter light forward or backward along the path of the light ray, so the veiling appears
            most intense looking into a low sun or with the sun at your back. Air molecules scatter much more light in
            directions oblique to the path of light, so the Raleigh scattering is little affected by time of day; this
            is also why the sky appears to be roughly the same blue color in all directions.</p>

          <p>Aerial perspective of any kind does not cause perceptible blurring of the image — which is obvious if you
            examine the daytime horizon with a telescope. Veiling acts instead to <i>obscure</i> the image, producing a
            fading or <b>reduction in lightness contrast</b> so that whites and blacks tend to fuse toward a middle
            gray. This lack of contrast makes all edges less distinct and increases the visual fusion of tiny details or
            textures into a homogenous color.</p>

          <p>Atmospheric blurring is almost always the result of <b>thermal turbulence</b>, the same phenomenon that
            causes stars to twinkle at night. Rising currents of warm air create a mixture of tiny pockets or cells of
            warmer (less dense) air and cooler (more dense) air, and these different air densities refract or scatter
            air at slightly different angles, acting like tiny lenses or prisms to distort the image passing through
            them, in the same way images are blurred by textured shower doors or rippling water.</p>

          <p>The takeaway is that aerial perspective arises from several different causes. All of them increase in
            effect with distance, but each of them produces subtly different effects on the color, contrast, image
            clarity and vertical consistency of the horizon backdrop for landscape painters.<a

          <h3>rainbows</h3>

          <p>To conclude these perspective studies, it's appropriate to look at rainbows. Rainbows became a significant
            theme in western art during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when academic perspective rigor was
            displaced by a new interest in the atmospheric effects of light and clouds. And so they signal the end of
            our perspective labors.</p>

          <p>The rainbow geometry is simple and everywhere the same: the essentials were clearly described in
            Aristotle's <i>Meteorology</i> about 2400 years ago. Once you understand this geometry it's truly amazing
            how many perspective howlers you can find in 18th and 19th century paintings — rainbows that are too wide,
            too narrow, curve with an incorrect radius, don't match the position of shadows or the sun, or are distorted
            by bogus foreshortening. These distortions often look odd even if the viewer cannot explain why, and they
            usually do not produce a pleasing effect.</p>

          <p class="imgC"><img src="./handprint _ shadows, reflections &amp; atmosphere 6_files/rainbow.gif" width="375"
              height="375"></p>
          <p class="CC">the geometry of rainbows</p>
          <p class="subCC">shown within a 90° circle of view; the sun is about 20° above the horizon (late afternoon)
          </p>

          <p>The rainbow is a <i>circular band of refracted light centered on the antisolar point</i> (<b>asp</b>), the
            point in the sky directly opposite from the sun (diagram, above). It results from the refraction and
            <i>one</i> internal reflection of light inside a raindrop, as described in the page on <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color10.html#raindrop">the causes of color</a>.</p>

          <p>The rainbow always has a radius (at its outer circumference) of 42° visual angle, and the spectral band is
            roughly 2° of visual angle wide (the width of four full moons). Colors are arranged in spectral order from
            red (at the outer edge) through yellow, green, blue to violet (at the inner edge). A useful mnemonic is
            <i><b>R</b>ed on the <b>R</b>im, <b>B</b>lue in the <b>B</b>owl of the Rainbow.</i></p>

          <p>Sometimes a second, fainter rainbow appears outside the first, the same width as the primary bow, with a
            radius of 51° visual angle from the <b>asp</b> to the inner edge. This secondary bow results from <i>two</i>
            internal reflections of the light ray inside the raindrop. The second reflection makes this second bow a
            mirror image of the primary bow, so the color order is reversed: red on the inner edge and blue to violet on
            the outer circumference.</p>

          <p>The perspective observer always appears to stand at the center of a celestial sphere, so the antisolar
            point <i>below the horizon</i> is always located at the center of the shadow of the observer's head <i>on
              the ground.</i></p>

          <p>The vertical shadow vanishing point (<b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i>) is located on the horizon on a vertical
            line from the antisolar point; the <b>svp</b> is always directly underneath the highest point in the curve
            of the rainbow and on level ground it is centered between the two rainbow ends.</p>

          <p>Raindrops <i>between</i> the apparent position of the primary and secondary bows do not refract light back
            to the viewer, so this area appears noticeably darker than the rest of the sky, an effect called
            <b>Alexander's dark band</b> (diagram, above).</p>

          <p>The area contained within the primary bow almost always appears significantly brighter (as well, to a
            lesser extent, the area outside the secondary bow) due to random white light scattering (image, right).
            Because this internal light is spectrally neutral, it can be tinted with any bias in the color of sunlight —
            typically the reddening of light at sunset. Sunrise or sunset rainbows also display significantly weakened
            green and violet bands, as these wavelengths are already filtered out of the light.</p>

          <p>All foreground shadows will seem to recede <i>into</i> the rainbow (a beautiful effect in a field of tall
            grass or a desert landscape of low brush), as shown by the two foreground posts (diagram, above). <a
              class="text" href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/artist05.html">J.M.W. Turner</a>, an extraordinarily
            observant artist and professor of perspective at the Royal Academy, was harshly critical of Peter Paul
            Rubens's <i>Rainbow Landscape</i> (in the Wallace Collection, London) because Rubens showed foreground
            shadows raking <i>sideways</i> in front of a rainbow in the distance. However, as the far right post in the
            illustration shows, <i>distant</i> objects at either end of the rainbow can be displaced so far to one side
            of the <b>svp</b> <i>vertical</i> that their shadows do seem to fall almost parallel with the horizon.</p>

          <p>We can never step to one side of a rainbow. A foreshortened rainbow, for example an arc from beyond the
            horizon that lands in a pot of gold at your feet, is optically impossible. The rainbow is always <b>centered
              on the shadow of the observer's head</b>, so the observer's apparent position is always directly in front
            of a perfectly circular rainbow arc. This is why rainbows appear to travel alongside an observer in a moving
            car or train. For the same reason, the sun and a rainbow can never appear in an image at the same time.
            Shafts of sunlight (for example, through the overhead clouds of a departing storm) will always appear to
            converge <i>into</i> the antisolar point at the center of the arc — another breathtaking atmospheric
            display.</p>

          <p>Seen in nearby waterfall mists or the spray from a garden hose, rainbows can appear nearly circular.
            However, when the sun is above the horizon (as it must be to light a landscape rainbow), the antisolar point
            is below the horizon, so the ground plane always cuts off half or more of the circular display. Rainbows
            seem to straighten and fall closer to the ground as the sun rises higher in the sky. At sunset or sunrise
            the rainbow can approach a semicircle and reach nearly halfway to the zenith (images, right).</p>

          <p>Rainbows cannot appear if the sun is higher than 42° in the sky, which gives them a subtle dependence on
            latitude, geography and time of day. They appear only during rainy seasons; during summer months (when the
            sun is often high in the sky) they appear only in the morning or afternoon, but during winter months (when
            the sun is always low in the sky) they may appear at any time of the day. The most spectacular displays
            occur when heavy rainstorms move eastward and break in the late afternoon. And rainbows in the northern
            hemisphere can never arc across the southern sky (because the sun must be at the viewer's back). Thus,
            rainbows depend on the same basic elements of <a class="text"
              href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html#imageplane">viewpoint and direction of view</a> that
            are always at the core of perspective studies; the beauty of rainbows is that they put these basic elements
            on display by combining radiant color with the facts of season, geography and time of day.</p>

          <p>Yet the spectral colors of the rainbow are not as pure as the colors seen through a prism. The intensity is
            reduced by <b>spectral smearing</b> or overlap between similar wavelengths, caused by the 1/2° angular
            diameter of the sun and by slightly divergent paths of light refracted through the raindrop. This smearing
            reduces the purity of "blue" spectral light by more than 75%, and the purity of "red" light by about 40%.
            Red is therefore usually the dominant or most vivid color in a rainbow, a bias that is enhanced around
            sunrise or sunset as the rainbow arc rises in the sky.</p>

          <p>The intensity of rainbow colors also varies with the amount of solar illumination and the darkness of
            background clouds or sky, and especially with the size of the raindrops. The largest drops (larger than 2mm)
            produce the brightest, clearest colors; as drops get smaller the colors appear "smudged" or whitened by
            overlapping spectral hues; the yellow and green bands are the first to fade to white. Smearing is extreme in
            mists where the drops are very small and evenly dispersed, so that all colors blend back into white. These
            achromatic <b>fogbows</b> have the same radius and obey the same perspective rules as a chromatic rainbow.
          </p>

          <p>Because there are more raindrops along a line of sight near parallel to the ground than upward toward the
            zenith, and as raindrops tend to increase in size by aggregation as they fall, these more abundant, larger
            raindrops produce colors that are brighter near the earth than at the top of the arc.</p>
