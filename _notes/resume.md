  * Facilitaing all kinds of scrum meetings like sprint planning, backlog refinement, retrospective and showcases.
  * Ensuring stable delivery during project migration period

Besides ensuring the successful production release of Digital API, I also have a habit of consistently improving our process and ways of working, including:

  * Revised our story template and Definition of Done, which unifies every checkpoint spreading across multiple sub-tasks into one single checklist. This makes it much easier to gaining context and work progress of every story.
  * Continuiously improve our backlog by elimilating the use of sub-tasks to manage different aspects of story ticket, which greatly reduced our number of tickets in backlog (from 180 tickets to 40)
  * Utilizing technique like User Story Map to visualize our Beta and MVP release scope and current delivery status, which helps both API team and client teams get a clear picture of our roadmap
  * Helped team aligning on many conventions, like API naming and time format standardization, which serves as a framework for our future API design
  * Actively communicate with both API team and client teams, weekly catchup with key roles, to make sure requirements gets understood and delivered exactly as our clients expected, which greatly reduce the number of requirements redo.
