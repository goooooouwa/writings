Gboard pros and cons

Pros

* Quick access Emojis, search GIFs and hand drawings  
* Google search and YouTube built in  
* Swapping keys makes typing fast and easy, like magic  
* Clean simple and fast, not missing native keyboard very much

Cons

* Trackpad only moves horizontal, but luckily wrapping lines fast.  
* No quick character selection by swapping with direction in 9-keys keyboard layout, e.g. quick select question mark.  
* Keys are shorter and smaller, harder to type (maybe saving space for Google search).
* Dictation requires jumping back and forth between current app and Gboard app, so that Gboard granted audio access.
